# 5.10 Conclusion

This chapter has presented a comprehensive system analysis and design blueprint for the Cafeteria Ordering and Loyalty Reward System, translating the project objectives defined in Chapter 3 into concrete technical specifications that will guide implementation.

The architecture adopts a modern **three-tier, cloud-native approach** leveraging Firebase Cloud Platform, Flutter for cross-platform mobile development, and React for administrative interfaces. This architectural decision balances academic rigor with practical implementation constraints, enabling a solo developer to deliver a production-quality system within a 10-week timeline while maintaining enterprise-grade scalability, security, and performance characteristics.

Most critically, the **requirements specification** (Section 5.9) formalized 35 functional requirements and 18 non-functional requirements, each with clear acceptance criteria and MoSCoW prioritization. These requirements provide measurable targets for development and testing, ensuring the implemented system addresses the problems identified in Chapter 1 through features validated by the research in Chapter 2.

The design successfully addresses the core challenges identified in Chapter 1: eliminating queue wait times through advance mobile ordering, reducing manual errors via digital order management, supporting mobile payments through M-Pesa integration, engaging customers through an integrated loyalty program, enabling pre-ordering capabilities, and providing data-driven business intelligence through analytics.

# 5.1 Overview

The system analysis and design phase translates project requirements into a concrete technical blueprint guiding implementation. This chapter presents the architectural design, data modeling, user interface specifications, and technical requirements for the Cafeteria Ordering and Loyalty Reward System.

## Architecture Overview

The system employs a **three-tier client-server architecture** leveraging cloud-native technologies for scalability and rapid development. The presentation tier consists of a Flutter mobile application for students and a React web dashboard for administrators. The application tier utilizes Firebase Cloud Functions for serverless business logic. The data tier combines Cloud Firestore for data persistence with M-Pesa Daraja API for payment processing.

This architecture provides strategic advantages: client-server separation enables independent scaling, cloud-native approach eliminates server overhead ideal for academic projects, and managed services reduce operational complexity. The mobile-first design acknowledges student preferences while the administrative web interface recognizes staff needs for larger screens.

## Design Philosophy

The design centers on five core principles: **simplicity**, **performance**, **scalability**, **security**, and **user-centricity**.

**Simplicity** uses managed cloud services rather than custom infrastructure. Flutter framework allows a single codebase for iOS and Android platforms.

**Performance** emphasizes strategic caching, optimized database queries, and asynchronous operations ensuring sub-second response times.

**Scalability** supports growth from hundreds to millions of users. Firestore provides horizontal scaling, Cloud Functions automatically scale, and stateless design enables load distribution.

**Security** integrates throughout with Firebase Authentic ation, HTTPS/TLS encryption, Firestore security rules, and M-Pesa's secure infrastructure for PCI DSS compliance.

**User-centricity** serves three personas: students seeking quick ordering, cafeteria staff requiring efficient management, and administrators needing analytics.

The design process followed an iterative methodology from high-level architecture through detailed component design to implementation specifications, selecting cloud-native, mobile-first architecture as the optimal balance of capability, cost, and best practices.

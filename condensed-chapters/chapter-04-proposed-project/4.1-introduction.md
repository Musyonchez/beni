# 4.1 Introduction

The Cafeteria Ordering and Loyalty Reward System represents a comprehensive digital transformation of campus dining services, addressing the problems documented in Chapter 1 through a mobile-first solution integrating ordering, payment, and customer engagement within a unified platform. This chapter outlines the proposed approach to developing this system, detailing project phases, timeline, resource requirements, and risk management strategies guiding implementation from conception through deployment and evaluation.

The project adopts an **agile, iterative development methodology** appropriate for a solo academic project with a 10-week timeline. Development proceeds through three clearly defined phases: **Research and Design (Weeks 1-3)**, **Development and Implementation (Weeks 4-8)**, and **Testing and Evaluation (Weeks 9-10)**. Each phase has specific deliverables and success criteria, ensuring measurable progress and enabling early identification of challenges requiring adjustment.

The technical approach centers on modern, cross-platform mobile development using **Flutter**, Google's UI toolkit for building natively compiled applications from a single codebase. This strategic choice enables high-quality mobile application development for both iOS and Android platforms simultaneously, maximizing user reach while minimizing development effort—critical for a solo developer within an academic timeline.

The backend architecture leverages **Firebase**, Google's Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) platform, providing managed cloud infrastructure eliminating the need for custom server provisioning, database administration, or scaling configuration. Firebase Cloud Firestore handles data persistence, Firebase Authentication manages user identity, and Firebase Cloud Functions execute server-side business logic. This cloud-native approach dramatically reduces operational complexity, allowing focus on application functionality rather than infrastructure maintenance.

Payment processing integrates **M-Pesa**, Kenya's dominant mobile money platform, through Safaricom's Daraja API. This  integration is essential for Kenyan university context where students predominantly use mobile money rather than credit cards. The STK Push (Lipa na M-Pesa Online) functionality enables seamless in-app payment initiation.

The development process prioritizes **user-centered design** through iterative prototyping,user testing, and continuous refinement based on feedback. Early wireframing establishes core user flows, followed by  functional prototype development tested with representative student users. This iterative approach ensures the final product genuinely addresses user needs rather than implementing technology for its own sake.

Risk management strategies identify potential project threats including technical challenges (API integration complexity, Firebase limitations, payment security), timeline constraints (feature scope creep, unforeseen technical issues), and user adoption barriers (resistance to change, usability issues). Mitigation strategies include prioritizing core features, maintaining schedule buffers, and conducting early user testing to identify problems when they're still easily addressable.

This chapter proceeds to detail the specific project phases, timeline with Gantt chart visualization, technical and resource requirements, and evaluation criteria that will measure project success against the objectives established in Chapter 3.

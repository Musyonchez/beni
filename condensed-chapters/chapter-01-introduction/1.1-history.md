# 1.1 History

The evolution of food service systems has undergone significant transformation over recent decades. Traditional cafeteria operations relied on manual face-to-face ordering, verbal communication, and cash transactions—a model functional for decades but increasingly limited in meeting modern expectations for speed, convenience, and digital integration.

Cafeteria-style dining emerged in the late 19th century with quick-service restaurants offering self-service buffet lines. University cafeterias adopted this model to serve large populations efficiently. However, as institutions grew and campus life accelerated, traditional queuing systems created significant bottlenecks during peak meal hours.

Digital technology entered food service in the 1990s with point-of-sale systems digitizing billing and inventory. The 2000s saw online food ordering platforms like GrubHub (2004), later expanded by Uber Eats and DoorDash. These platforms demonstrated that customers valued browsing menus, customizing orders, and paying digitally from mobile devices while avoiding physical queues.

The smartphone revolution, catalyzed by the iPhone (2007) and subsequent mobile application proliferation, created new possibilities for institutional food service transformation. Universities recognized that tech-savvy students expected the same digital convenience in campus dining that they experienced with commercial food delivery apps.

Parallel to ordering systems evolved customer loyalty programs. Modern digital loyalty programs gained prominence in airlines (1980s frequent flyer miles) and were adopted by retail and coffee shops. Starbucks revolutionized loyalty programs with its mobile app-based rewards system (2009), demonstrating that seamless ordering and loyalty integration could drive customer retention and increased spending.

The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated contactless ordering and payment adoption across food service. Institutions delayed in digital transformation rapidly implemented mobile ordering to maintain operations under social distancing requirements. This normalized the expectation that food ordering should be mobile-accessible with advance ordering, mobile payment, and real-time tracking becoming standard.

Despite broader industry trends, many university cafeterias continue operating with predominantly manual systems, creating a disconnect between student expectations shaped by commercial apps and campus dining reality. This gap represents both a challenge and an opportunity for universities to enhance student experience, improve operational efficiency, and generate data insights through integrated mobile ordering and loyalty reward systems designed for campus environments.

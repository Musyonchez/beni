# 2.6 Conclusion

This literature review has examined mobile food ordering and loyalty reward systems across global, regional, and local perspectives, analyzing successful commercial platforms, campus dining solutions, and traditional cafeteria operations to inform the proposed system design.

The global perspective revealed that platforms like Grubhub Campus and CBORD demonstrate the viability and benefits of mobile ordering in institutional settings, including improved student experience, operational efficiency, and data-driven decision-making. However, their high costs and North American optimization limit applicability to resource-constrained markets.

The regional perspective highlighted how platforms like Jumia Food and Glovo successfully adapt digital ordering to African contexts through M-Pesa integration, connectivity optimization, and landmark-based addressing. While designed for restaurant delivery rather than institutional cafeterias, these platforms prove that African users embrace mobile ordering when properly localized.

The local perspective documented the current state of Kenyan university cafeterias, where manual operations create long queues, limited payment options, and missed opportunities for customer engagement. Emerging digital initiatives demonstrate both student receptiveness and institutional willingness to adopt solutions, constrained primarily by cost and lack of appropriate systems.

The comparative analysis identified critical gaps: affordable campus-specific solutions for developing markets, integrated loyalty and engagement features, student-centric functionalities, and institutional control without vendor lock-in. These gaps represent the design opportunity for the proposed Cafeteria Ordering and Loyalty Reward System.

By synthesizing global best practices (seamless mobile ordering, real-time tracking, analytics), regional adaptations (M-Pesa integration, connectivity optimization, African UX patterns), and local context understanding (Kenyan university operational realities, student preferences, budget constraints), this literature review establishes the foundation for a system that is both globally informed and locally appropriate—addressing real needs identified in Chapter 1 through proven approaches adapted to the specific university cafeteria context in Kenya.

The subsequent chapters will translate these insights into concrete system objectives, detailed design specifications, and implementation strategies that leverage the strengths and address the limitations identified in this review.

# 2.1 Introduction

The purpose of this literature review is to examine existing mobile food ordering and loyalty reward systems to identify best practices and gaps that the proposed Cafeteria Ordering and Loyalty Reward System aims to address. This review provides the theoretical and practical foundation by analyzing solutions in commercial, institutional, and campus settings.

The scope encompasses three perspectives: global, regional, and local. The global perspective examines successful platforms from developed markets where digital transformation is most advanced. The regional perspective focuses on African solutions considering unique factors like mobile payment ecosystems and infrastructure challenges. The local perspective examines Kenyan university food service systems.

Each system is analyzed along key dimensions: problems addressed, features offered, technology stack, user experience, payment integration, loyalty mechanisms, strengths, and limitations. This framework enables meaningful comparison across diverse contexts.

The synthesis of findings from these three perspectives culminates in a comparative analysis highlighting common strengths, prevalent weaknesses, and identified gaps that the proposed system will address.

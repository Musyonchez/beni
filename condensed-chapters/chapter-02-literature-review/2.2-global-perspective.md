# 2.2 Global Perspective

## 2.2.1 Grubhub Campus Dining Solutions (United States)

**Overview:**  
Grubhub Campus operates at over 250 U.S. college campuses, providing white-labeled mobile ordering specifically for institutional dining. Unlike standard Grubhub focused on restaurant delivery, Grubhub Campus enables students to order from on-campus cafeterias and food courts for pickup or limited campus delivery.

**Key Features:**  
The platform integrates mobile ordering, digital payment, and location-based services. Students access branded institutional apps showing real-time menus with detailed descriptions, nutritional information, allergen warnings, and dietary filters (vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, halal). The system allows multi-item orders, meal plan credit application, and scheduled pickup aligned with class schedules. Real-time tracking notifies students when orders are received, being prepared, and ready for pickup.

Integration with institutional payment systems enables students to pay using existing meal plans, declining balance accounts, or cards without separate payment setup. Features include order history, favorites for quick reordering, and personalized recommendations based on purchase patterns.

**Technology Architecture:**  
Cloud-based backend on AWS ensures scalability during peak demand. Native iOS and Android apps provide optimized performance. Integration with campus ERP systems handles authentication, meal plan balances, and transactions. Point-of-sale terminals receive orders through kitchen display systems.

**Strengths:**  
Proven scalability serving millions of orders. Deep integration with campus systems (student IDs, meal plans) removes adoption friction. White-label approach maintains institutional branding while leveraging Grubhub's infrastructure. Analytics dashboard provides valuable business intelligence for menu planning, inventory management, and staffing optimization. Professional UX design meets student expectations.

**Limitations:**  
Substantial annual licensing fees ($30,000-$100,000+) make it prohibitive for smaller institutions or developing markets. Optimized for North American market; features don't translate well to different contexts (no M-Pesa support). Requires continuous internet connectivity, problematic in areas with unreliable access. Data privacy concerns about third-party vendor control over student dining data. Vendor lock-in creates sustainability risks if pricing changes or Grubhub exits the market.

## 2.2.2 CBORD GET Mobile and Campus Dining Solutions (Global)

**Overview:**  
CBORD, established in 1975, provides integrated campus technology solutions. The CBORD GET (Grub, Events, Transactions) mobile app deploys at over 400 universities worldwide including U.S., Canada, UK, and Australia, serving medium to large universities with complex dining operations.

**Key Features:**  
Comprehensive functionality spans menu browsing, mobile ordering, nutritional analysis, and account management. Real-time menus include detailed nutritional information (calories, macronutrients, vitamins), complete ingredient lists, and allergen labeling. The NetNutrition feature allows meal planning, daily intake tracking, favorite item alerts, and dietary request submission.

Mobile ordering supports scheduled pickup, walk-up pickup, and limited delivery. Integration with CS Gold financial platform enables payment via meal plan blocks, declining balance accounts, or external cards. Students view real-time balances, track spending, and receive low-balance alerts.

Engagement features include facility ratings/reviews, social meal sharing, and healthy eating gamification. Operational tools for dining staff include order management, inventory tracking, and menu planning workflows.

**Technology Architecture:**  
Service-oriented architecture integrates with CBORD's ecosystem (CS Gold, Housing, student ID systems). Tight integration enables capabilities like proximity-based app opening and pre-loading orders based on class schedules. Deployment options include on-premises or cloud hosting.

**Strengths:**  
Deep integration across campus ecosystem provides seamless single sign-on, automatic payment, and smooth data flow. Mature platform refined through decades of client feedback. Scales from small colleges to large universities. Professional implementation support reduces institutional IT burden. Strong emphasis on nutrition and health aligns with wellness-focused university culture.

**Limitations:**  
Complex and expensive to implement with significant licensing costs and 6-12 month implementation timelines. Steep learning curve for administrators requiring extensive training. Optimized for North American higher education model; features assume operational norms (meal plans, campus IDs, specific labeling standards) that may not exist elsewhere. App sometimes criticized for being less polished than consumer food delivery apps. Vendor lock-in across CBORD's ecosystem makes switching difficult.

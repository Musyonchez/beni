ABSTRACT  
The current cafeteria ordering process in many  university campuses involves long queues, 
inefficient manual ordering, limited payment options, and lack of customer engagement through 
rewards programs. Students and staff often face significant time wastage during peak hours, 
leading to missed meals or late arrivals to classes and meetings. This project proposes the design 
and development of a  Cafeteria Ordering and Loyalty Reward Mobile Application  that addresses 
these challenges by providing a streamlined digital ordering system with integrated custome r 
loyalty features.  
The primary objective of this system is to create a user -friendly mobile solution that enables 
students and staff to browse the cafeteria menu, place orders in advance, make secure digital 
payments, and earn loyalty points for every pur chase. The application will integrate Firebase 
Firestore for real -time data management, enabling seamless synchronization between customer 
orders and cafeteria staff interfaces. The system will feature role -based access for customers, 
cafeteria staff, and administrators, ensuring efficient order management and business operations.  
A phased methodology will be adopted in the development of this system, including 
comprehensive requirements gathering, system design, implementation using modern mobile 
development frameworks, rigorous testing, and user evaluation. The application will incorporate 
key features such as menu browsing with real -time availability, shopping cart management, 
multiple payment gateway integration, order tracking with notification s, a points -based loyalty 
rewards system, and detailed analytics for cafeteria management.  
The expected outcome is a reliable and efficient mobile application that reduces waiting times, 
improves customer satisfaction, increases cafeteria revenue through r epeat business incentivized 
by the loyalty program, and provides valuable business insights through data analytics. This project 
not only addresses a practical operational problem but also contributes to the broader vision of 
building smart campus solution s by leveraging modern mobile technologies and cloud -based 
services.  
By implementing this system, the cafeteria will benefit from reduced queue congestion, improved 
order accuracy, better inventory management, and enhanced customer engagement. Students and  
staff will enjoy the convenience of pre -ordering meals, earning rewards for loyalty, and having a 
more pleasant dining experience with minimized waiting times.

1 CHAPTER ONE: INTRODUCTION  
1.1 History  
The evolution of food service and  ordering systems has undergone significant transformation over 
the past few decades, particularly in institutional settings such as universities, corporate cafeterias, 
and public dining facilities. Traditional cafeteria operations have relied on manual, f ace-to-face 
ordering processes where customers queue at service counters, verbally communicate their orders 
to staff, and make payments primarily through cash or basic card transactions. This conventional 
model, while functional for decades, has increasing ly shown its limitations in the context of 
modern expectations for speed, convenience, and digital integration.  
The origins of cafeteria -style dining can be traced back to the late 19th and early 20th centuries 
when quick -service restaurants began offering  self-service buffet lines to serve large numbers of 
customers efficiently. University and institutional cafeterias adopted this model to feed thousands 
of students and staff daily. However, as these institutions grew in size and the pace of campus life 
accelerated, the traditional queuing system began to create significant bottlenecks, especially 
during peak meal hours between classes.  
The advent of digital technology in the food service industry began in the 1990s with point -of-sale 
(POS) systems that dig itized billing and inventory management. The early 2000s saw the 
emergence of online food ordering platforms for restaurant delivery, pioneered by companies like 
GrubHub (founded in 2004) and later expanded by Uber Eats and DoorDash in the 2010s. These 
platforms demonstrated that customers valued the convenience of browsing menus, customizing 
orders, and paying digitally from their mobile devices, all while avoiding physical queues.  
The smartphone revolution, catalyzed by the introduction of the iPhone in 2 007 and the subsequent 
proliferation of mobile applications, created new possibilities for transforming institutional food 
service. Universities and corporate cafeterias began to recognize that their customers —
predominantly tech -savvy students and young pr ofessionals —expected the same level of digital 
convenience in campus dining that they experienced with commercial food delivery apps. Early 
adopters of mobile ordering in institutional settings reported significant improvements in 
operational efficiency, c ustomer satisfaction, and revenue generation.  
Parallel to the evolution of ordering systems has been the development of customer loyalty and 
rewards programs. The concept of rewarding repeat customers dates back to the late 18th century 
with merchants offe ring tokens for future purchases. However, modern digital loyalty programs 
gained prominence in the airline industry in the 1980s with frequent flyer miles, and were later 
adopted by retail chains and coffee shops. Starbucks revolutionized loyalty programs  in the food 
service sector with its mobile app -based rewards system launched in 2009, demonstrating that 
seamless integration of ordering and loyalty features could drive both customer retention and 
increased spending.  

================================================================================

================================================================================

In recent years, the COVID -19 pandem ic accelerated the adoption of contactless ordering and 
payment systems across all sectors of the food service industry. Institutions that had delayed digital 
transformation were forced to rapidly implement mobile ordering solutions to maintain operations 
while adhering to social distancing requirements. This global shift normalized the expectation that 
food ordering should be available through mobile applications, with features such as advance 
ordering, mobile payment, and real -time order tracking becoming  standard rather than premium 
offerings.  
Despite these broader industry trends, many university cafeterias continue to operate with 
predominantly manual systems, creating a disconnect between student expectations shaped by 
commercial food apps and the real ity of campus dining. This gap represents both a challenge and 
an opportunity for modern universities to enhance student experience, improve operational 
efficiency, and generate valuable data insights through the implementation of integrated mobile 
orderin g and loyalty reward systems specifically designed for the unique needs of campus 
environments.  
1.2 Problem Statement  
The current cafeteria ordering process at many university campuses, including the target institution 
for this project, faces several criti cal challenges that negatively impact both customer satisfaction 
and operational efficiency. These challenges have become increasingly pronounced as student 
expectations for digital convenience have risen, while cafeteria operations have largely remained 
unchanged.  
Long Queue Wait Times During Peak Hours  
The most visible and frustrating problem is the formation of excessively long queues during peak 
meal hours, typically between 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM when classes break for lunch. Observational 
studies and in formal student surveys indicate that students often wait 15 -30 minutes in line during 
these periods, with wait times occasionally exceeding 40 minutes during particularly busy days. 
This time wastage has several negative consequences: students either skip meals entirely to avoid 
missing subsequent classes, arrive late to afternoon lectures, or experience increased stress and 
reduced satisfaction with campus life. For an institution where time management is crucial for 
academic success, these delays represen t a significant quality -of-life issue.  
The queueing problem is exacerbated by the sequential nature of traditional ordering. Each 
customer must wait for those ahead of them to browse the menu, make decisions, communicate 
orders, wait for preparation, and c omplete payment —all at the service counter. This creates a 
cascading delay effect where even simple orders are slowed by more complex ones ahead in line. 
During peak hours, the limited number of service points becomes a severe bottleneck, with three 
or fou r counters attempting to serve hundreds of students simultaneously.  
Manual Ordering Inefficiencies and Errors  

================================================================================
PAGE 9
================================================================================

The current manual ordering system relies heavily on verbal communication between customers 
and cafeteria staff. This process is inherently prone to miscommunication, particularly in noisy 
cafeteria environments or when serving international students who may face language barriers. 
Order errors result in customer dissatisfaction, food waste, and time lost in corrections. Staff must 
repeatedly explai n menu options, prices, and daily specials to individual customers, creating 
redundant work that could be eliminated through digital systems.  
Furthermore, the lack of a digital ordering system means customers cannot carefully review menu 
options, nutrition al information, or pricing before reaching the counter. This forces hasty decision -
making at the point of service, contributing to longer service times and potentially less satisfactory 
meal choices. Students with dietary restrictions or allergen concerns face particular challenges in 
obtaining accurate information about ingredients and preparation methods within the time -
pressured queue environment.  
Limited Payment Options and Cash Management Challenges  
Many campus cafeterias continue to rely primarily on cash transactions or basic card swipe 
systems, creating multiple problems. Cash handling is time -consuming for both staff and 
customers, requires secure storage and daily reconciliation, and introduces risks of theft or errors 
in giving change. Students in creasingly prefer cashless transactions and may not carry sufficient 
cash for meal purchases, particularly if they need to visit ATMs located elsewhere on campus.  
The absence of modern digital payment integration means students cannot use mobile money 
services such as M -Pesa, which have become ubiquitous payment methods in Kenya and other 
African countries, or international options like Apple Pay or Google Pay. This payment limitation 
is particularly frustrating for a digitally native student population acc ustomed to seamless mobile 
transactions in other aspects of their lives.  
Absence of Customer Engagement and Loyalty Incentives  
Unlike commercial food service establishments that have embraced loyalty programs to encourage 
repeat business, most university c afeterias operate without any systematic approach to rewarding 
regular customers. There is no mechanism to track purchasing patterns, reward frequent visitors, 
or incentivize students to choose campus dining options over off -campus alternatives. This 
repre sents a missed opportunity both for building customer loyalty and for generating valuable 
data about student preferences and behavior.  
Students who eat at the cafeteria daily receive no recognition or benefits for their consistent 
patronage, while those who occasionally use the service are treated identically. This lack of 
differentiation fails to leverage the proven effectiveness of loyalty programs in increasing customer 
retention and lifetime value. Commercial competitors near campus offering rew ard points or 
discounts for repeat purchases gain an advantage over the campus cafeteria despite potentially 
offering less convenient locations.  

================================================================================
PAGE 10
================================================================================

Lack of Pre -Ordering Capability Leading to Missed Opportunities  
The absence of advance ordering functionality f orces all transactions to occur in real -time during 
the brief windows when students can physically visit the cafeteria between classes. Students cannot 
order ahead for specific pickup times, meaning they must either arrive early and wait, or join the 
queue  and risk being late to subsequent commitments. This inflexibility particularly affects 
students with tight class schedules or those participating in extracurricular activities with fixed 
timing.  
The inability to pre -order also impacts operational planning  for cafeteria staff. Without advance 
knowledge of order volumes and specific items needed, staff must rely on historical patterns and 
guesswork for food preparation and inventory management. This leads to either food waste when 
items are over -prepared or stockouts when demand exceeds expectations, both of which harm 
customer satisfaction and profitability.  
Insufficient Business Intelligence and Data -Driven Decision Making  
The current manual system provides minimal data for management decision -making. Sales  are 
typically tracked only at an aggregate level, with limited visibility into which specific menu items 
are popular, when peak demand occurs, what price points drive purchases, or how customer 
preferences change over time. This data deficiency makes it d ifficult to optimize menu offerings, 
adjust pricing strategically, manage inventory efficiently, or make evidence -based decisions about 
operational improvements.  
Furthermore, without individual customer data through digital accounts, the cafeteria cannot 
personalize communications, send targeted promotions, or understand customer lifetime value. 
Marketing efforts remain generic and untargeted, reducing their effectiveness and missing 
opportunities to increase engagement and revenue.  
Impact on Academic Perfo rmance and Campus Experience  
The cumulative effect of these problems extends beyond mere inconvenience. Students who 
regularly skip meals due to long queues may experience reduced academic performance due to 
hunger and decreased concentration. The stress of navigating crowded cafeterias and potentially 
being late to classes contributes to overall campus stress levels. For international students or those 
living on campus without easy access to off -campus dining options, these chall enges 
disproportionately affect their quality of life and integration into the university community.  
These challenges are not unique to a single institution but are representative of cafeteria operations 
at universities across Kenya and the broader East Af rican region. However, they are particularly 
acute at institutions experiencing enrollment growth, where cafeteria infrastructure has not scaled 
proportionally to accommodate increasing student populations. The solution requires a 
comprehensive digital tra nsformation that addresses ordering convenience, payment flexibility, 

================================================================================
PAGE 11
================================================================================

customer engagement, and operational intelligence through an integrated mobile application 
system.  
1.3 Conclusion  
This chapter has established the evolution of food service ordering syst ems from traditional manual 
processes to modern digital platforms, highlighting how technological advancements in mobile 
computing, payment systems, and customer relationship management have transformed 
commercial food service while many institutional cafe terias have remained largely unchanged. 
The historical context demonstrates that customer expectations for digital convenience are not 
speculative but are rooted in proven industry trends and the widespread adoption of mobile 
ordering platforms across vari ous sectors.  
The detailed problem statement has identified multiple interconnected challenges facing university 
cafeteria operations, including excessive queue wait times, manual ordering inefficiencies, limited 
payment options, absence of loyalty programs , lack of pre -ordering capabilities, and insufficient 
data for business intelligence. These problems collectively create a suboptimal experience for 
students and represent missed opportunities for operational improvements and revenue 
enhancement for cafete ria management.  
The magnitude and interconnected nature of these challenges necessitate a comprehensive solution 
that goes beyond incremental improvements to existing processes. What is required is a 
fundamental transformation of the cafeteria ordering exp erience through the implementation of a 
mobile application that integrates ordering, payment, and loyalty reward functionality within a 
unified platform. Such a solution must be specifically designed for the university context, 
accounting for the unique ch aracteristics of campus dining including concentrated peak demand 
periods, diverse user populations with varying technical literacy, and the need for both convenience 
and affordability.  
The subsequent chapters of this report will explore existing solutions  implemented at other 
institutions and in the commercial sector (Chapter 2), define specific objectives for the proposed 
system (Chapter 3), outline the project plan and methodology (Chapter 4), present the detailed 
system design (Chapter 5), document the implementation process (Chapter 6), evaluate system 
performance and user acceptance (Chapter 7), and conclude with reflections on achievements, 
challenges, and future work (Chapter 8). By addressing the problems identified in this introduction 
through a we ll-designed mobile application with integrated loyalty rewards, this project aims to 
significantly improve the campus dining experience while providing a foundation for ongoing 
operational improvements and customer engagement initiatives.

2.Chapter two: Literature review  
2.1 Introduction  
The purpose of this literature review is to examine existing mobile food ordering and loyalty 
reward systems across different geographical and institutional contexts to understand their 
approaches, identify best practices , and recognize gaps that the proposed Cafeteria Ordering and 
Loyalty Reward System aims to address. This review provides the theoretical and practical 
foundation for the project by analyzing how similar problems have been solved in commercial, 
institution al, and campus settings globally, regionally within Africa, and locally within Kenya.  
The scope of this literature review encompasses three distinct perspectives: global, regional, and 
local. The global perspective examines successful mobile food ordering platforms and campus 
dining solutions from developed markets, particularly in North America, Europe, and Asia, where 
digital transformation of food service has been most advanced. The regional perspective focuses 
on food ordering and payment systems develo ped specifically for African markets, considering 
unique contextual factors such as mobile payment ecosystem maturity, infrastructure challenges, 
and cultural preferences. The local perspective examines Kenyan university and institutional food 
service syst ems, providing direct insights into the specific operating environment for the proposed 
system.  
This review is organized systematically to facilitate comparative analysis. Section 2.2 presents the 
global perspective, analyzing two to three internationally recognized food ordering platforms or 
university campus dining systems, examining their features, user experience, technology 
architecture, and business models. Section 2.3 shifts to the regional perspective, reviewing two 
food service technology implement ations from African countries, with attention to how they 
address continent -specific challenges and opportunities. Section 2.4 provides the local perspective 
through examination of two Kenyan university or institutional cafeteria systems, whether digital 
or traditional, to understand current practices and user expectations within the target deployment 
context.  
The methodology employed in this literature review combines academic sources, industry reports, 
system documentation, and hands -on evaluation of publ icly accessible platforms. Academic 
databases including Google Scholar and IEEE Xplore were searched using keywords such as 
"mobile food ordering," "university cafeteria systems," "loyalty rewards programs," "campus 
dining technology," and "mobile payment integration." Industry sources including technology 
blogs, company case studies, and app store reviews provided insights into user experiences and 
system capabilities. Where possible, the reviewed systems were directly tested through mobile 
applications or  web interfaces to gain first -hand understanding of their functionality, user interface 
design, and operational workflows.  
Each system reviewed in this chapter is analyzed along several dimensions: the problem it 
addresses, key features offered, technology  stack employed, user interface and experience design, 

================================================================================
PAGE 13
================================================================================

payment integration approach, loyalty or engagement mechanisms, strengths that make it 
successful, and limitations or weaknesses that represent opportunities for improvement. This 
consistent analytical  framework enables meaningful comparison across diverse systems and 
contexts, ultimately informing the design decisions for the proposed Cafeteria Ordering and 
Loyalty Reward System.  
The synthesis of findings from these three perspectives —global best pract ices, regional 
adaptations, and local context —culminates in Section 2.5, which presents a comparative analysis 
highlighting common strengths, prevalent weaknesses, and identified gaps that the proposed 
system will address. Section 2.6 concludes the literat ure review by articulating how the insights 
gained justify and inform the specific approach taken in this project, positioning it as both 
grounded in proven practices and innovative in addressing unmet needs within the university 
cafeteria context.  
 
2.2 Gl obal Perspective  
2.2.1 Grubhub Campus Dining Solutions (United States)  
Overview  
Grubhub, founded in 2004 and now one of North America's largest online and mobile food 
ordering platforms, has developed specialized solutions for university campuses under the 
"Grubhub Campus" brand. Operating at over 250 college campuses across the United States, 
Grubhub Campus provides a white -labeled mobile ordering platform specifically designed for 
institutional dining environments. Unlike the standard Grubhub con sumer app focused on 
restaurant delivery, Grubhub Campus enables students to order meals from on -campus dining 
facilities including cafeterias, food courts, and campus -operated restaurants for both pickup and 
limited delivery within campus bounds.  
Key Feat ures and Functionality  
The Grubhub Campus platform integrates mobile ordering, digital payment, and location -based 
services within a unified student experience. Students download a branded institutional app (e.g., 
"Cornell Dining" or "USC Mobile Food") tha t connects to all participating campus dining 
locations. The system provides real -time menu browsing with detailed item descriptions, 
nutritional information, allergen warnings, and customization options for each dish. Students can 
filter menus by dietary preferences (vegetarian, vegan, gluten -free, halal, etc.), making it 
particularly valuable for students with dietary restrictions who may struggle to identify suitable 
options in traditional cafeteria lines.  
The ordering workflow allows students to build m ulti-item orders, apply meal plan credits or 
dining dollars, and schedule pickup times that align with their class schedules. Real -time order 
tracking notifies students when their orders are received, being prepared, and ready for pickup, 

================================================================================
PAGE 14
================================================================================

reducing uncertai nty and unnecessary waiting. The integration with institutional payment systems 
is particularly noteworthy —students can pay using their existing meal plans, declining balance 
accounts, or credit/debit cards, eliminating the need for separate payment setup and leveraging 
existing campus financial infrastructure.  
Grubhub Campus incorporates elements of customer engagement through order history, favorite 
orders for quick reordering, and personalized recommendations based on past purchases. Some 
implementations  include loyalty programs where frequent orders earn points redeemable for free 
items or discounts, though this varies by institution based on their contract terms with Grubhub. 
The platform also provides location -based notifications alerting students when  they're near dining 
facilities with special offers or shorter wait times, encouraging utilization during off -peak hours.  
Technology Architecture  
The system architecture employs a cloud -based backend hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS), 
ensuring scalabilit y during peak demand periods such as lunch hours when thousands of students 
may place orders simultaneously. Native mobile applications for IOS and Android provide 
optimized performance and offline capability for viewing menus even without connectivity. Th e 
backend integrates with campus ERP systems (Enterprise Resource Planning) for student 
authentication, meal plan balances, and financial transactions. Point -of-sale terminals in dining 
facilities receive orders directly through kitchen display systems (KD S), streamlining food 
preparation workflows.  
Strengths  
The primary strength of Grubhub Campus is its proven scalability and reliability, refined through 
years of operation serving millions of user orders across diverse institutional contexts. The deep 
integration with existing campus systems (student IDs, meal plans, dining dollars) removes friction 
from adoption —students don't need separate accounts or payment methods beyond what they 
already use for campus services. The white -label approach allows institu tions to maintain their 
brand identity while benefiting from Grubhub's technology infrastructure and ongoing platform 
development.  
The sophisticated analytics dashboard provided to campus dining administrators offers valuable 
business intelligence includin g sales trends, popular items, peak demand periods, and student 
dietary preference patterns. This data enables evidence -based decision -making for menu planning, 
inventory management, and staffing optimization. The professional user experience design, 
polis hed through extensive consumer testing, provides students with an interface comparable to 
commercial apps they use for off -campus food delivery, meeting their expectations for digital 
convenience.  
Limitations  

================================================================================
PAGE 15
================================================================================

Despite its strengths, Grubhub Campus has notab le limitations. The platform operates on a 
subscription -based pricing model where institutions pay annual licensing fees that can be 
substantial (typically $30,000 -$100,000+ depending on student population), making it 
economically prohibitive for smaller i nstitutions or those in developing markets. Transaction fees 
on orders may also apply, potentially increasing overall costs. The system is optimized for the 
North American market, with features and assumptions that may not translate well to different 
cultu ral or operational contexts —for instance, integration with M -Pesa or other African mobile 
money services is not supported.  
The reliance on cloud infrastructure and continuous internet connectivity can be problematic in 
environments with unreliable internet  access. While the apps have some offline capabilities for 
menu viewing, order placement requires connectivity, which could be limiting in regions with 
infrastructure challenges. Additionally, the platform's focus on individual orders rather than 
communal or group dining, which may be more culturally relevant in some contexts, represents a 
potential mismatch.  
Some campus stakeholders have raised concerns about data privacy and institutional control over 
student dining data. As orders flow through Grubhub's systems, questions arise about who owns 
the data, how it's used for Grubhub's own analytics or marketing purposes, and what happens upon 
contract termination. The dependency on a third -party vendor also creates sustainability risks —if 
Grubhub changes prici ng, features, or decides to exit the campus market, institutions have limited 
alternatives without significant disruption.  
2.2.2 CBORD GET Mobile and Campus Dining Solutions (Global)  
Overview  
CBORD, established in 1975 and acquired by Roper Technologies in  2019, is a leading provider 
of integrated campus technology solutions, particularly known for its nutrition services, campus 
ID card systems, and institutional food service management platforms. The CBORD GET (Grub, 
Events, Transactions) mobile applicatio n represents their mobile -first strategy for campus dining, 
deployed at over 400 colleges and universities worldwide including institutions in the United 
States, Canada, United Kingdom, Australia, and select emerging markets. CBORD's solutions are 
particul arly prevalent at medium to large universities with complex dining operations including 
multiple cafeterias, food courts, retail locations, and catering services.  
Key Features and Functionality  
CBORD GET provides comprehensive functionality spanning menu b rowsing, mobile ordering, 
nutritional analysis, and dining account management within a single unified platform. The mobile 
application displays real -time menus for all campus dining locations, updated automatically by 
dining staff through integrated backen d systems. Each menu item includes detailed nutritional 
information (calories, macronutrients, vitamins, minerals), complete ingredient lists, and clear 

================================================================================
PAGE 16
================================================================================

allergen labeling (gluten, dairy, nuts, soy, etc.), addressing the needs of health -conscious students 
and those with dietary restrictions far more comprehensively than traditional cafeteria signage.  
The "NetNutrition" feature, integrated within GET, allows students to plan entire meals and track 
daily nutritional intake, appealing to students monitoring fit ness goals or managing medical 
conditions like diabetes. Students can create meal plans in advance, receive alerts when favorite 
items are served, and even submit dietary requests or preferences directly to dining staff. This level 
of personalization and h ealth consciousness represents a significant advancement over traditional 
cafeteria models where nutritional information is often unavailable or difficult to access.  
Mobile ordering through GET supports multiple fulfillment models including scheduled picku p, 
walk -up pickup with minimal wait, and limited on -campus delivery where implemented. 
Integration with CBORD's CS Gold financial platform enables seamless payment using meal plan 
blocks, declining balance accounts (dining dollars, flex dollars), or extern al payment cards. 
Students can view real -time account balances, track spending patterns, and receive low -balance 
alerts, providing financial transparency that helps them manage limited budgets.  
The platform includes engagement features such as dining facil ity ratings and reviews, social 
sharing of meals, and participation in campus dining events or challenges. Some implementations 
gamify healthy eating by awarding points for balanced meals or trying new menu items. CBORD 
GET also provides operational tools for dining staff including order management interfaces, 
inventory tracking integration, and menu planning workflows that ensure consistency between 
what's advertised in the app and what's actually available.  
Technology Architecture and Integration  
CBORD GE T is built on a service -oriented architecture (SOA) that integrates with CBORDs 
broader ecosystem of campus solutions including CS Gold (cashless campus commerce), HL 
(Housing and Residence Life), and student ID card systems. This tight integration enables  
powerful capabilities like using proximity sensors to automatically open the app when students 
approach dining facilities, or pre -loading orders based on expected arrival time derived from class 
schedules stored in student information systems.  
The backend  infrastructure is deployed on -premises at institutions or via cloud hosting depending 
on client preference, with recent emphasis on cloud migration for improved scalability and reduced 
institutional IT burden. APIs enable integration with third -party syst ems including ERP platforms 
(Ellucian Banner, Oracle PeopleSoft), learning management systems, and campus mobile apps that 
aggregate multiple services. The mobile applications use push notifications to alert students about 
special menus, limited -time offer s, or urgent operational updates (e.g., facility closures).  
Strengths  
CBORD's greatest strength is the depth of integration across the entire campus ecosystem. Because 
CBORD often provides multiple systems (dining, ID cards, housing, commerce), the integra tion 

================================================================================
PAGE 17
================================================================================

between GET and these systems is seamless and robust. Students experience true single sign -on 
using their institutional credentials, payment works automatically withexisting accounts, and 
operational data flows correctly between systems without manual  reconciliation.  
The longstanding presence in higher education has resulted in a mature platform with extensive 
features refined through decades of client feedback. The system scales well from small colleges to 
large research universities with tens of thou sands of students. CBORD's professional services team 
provides significant implementation support, training, and ongoing account management, reducing 
the burden on institutional IT staff.  
The emphasis on nutrition and health sets CBORD apart from purely transactional ordering 
platforms. Features like Ne  
tNutrition and meal planning appeal to the wellness -focused culture of many contemporary 
universities and align with institutional goals around student health. The data collected through 
GET provide s valuable insights for menu planning and can support public health research on eating 
behaviors.  
Limitations  
CBORD's solutions, while powerful, are complex and expensive to implement. Licensing costs 
are significant, particularly for the full suite of int egrated systems required to unlock GET's 
complete functionality. Implementation timelines can extend to 6 -12 months or more for large 
institutions, requiring substantial project management and change management efforts. The 
learning curve for administrativ e users (dining staff, IT administrators) is steep, potentially 
requiring extensive training and ongoing support.  
The system's optimization for the North American higher education model limits its applicability 
in different cultural or institutional contex ts. Features assume certain operational norms (meal plan 
systems, campus ID cards, specific dietary labeling standards) that may not exist elsewhere. 
International deployments often require significant customization. The mobile app, while 
functional, somet imes receives user criticism for being less polished or intuitive than consumer 
food delivery apps, potentially due to the need to accommodate extensive features within a single 
interface.  
Dependencies on CBORD's broader ecosystem can create vendor lock -in where institutions feel 
unable to switch providers for one system without disrupting others. Updates and new features 
follow CBORD's roadmap rather than being fully customizable to individual institutional 
priorities. Smaller institutions or those in reso urce-constrained settings may find the total cost of 
ownership prohibitive, even if the platform's capabilities would address their needs.  
2.3 Regional Perspective  
2.3.1 Jumia Food (Pan -African - Kenya, Nigeria, Uganda)  

================================================================================
PAGE 18
================================================================================

Overview  
Jumia Food, operating as part of the broader Jumia Group ecosystem (often called "Africa's 
Amazon"), represents one of the most successful adaptations of online food ordering to African 
markets. Launched in 2013 and operating across multiple African countries includin g Kenya, 
Nigeria, Uganda, Tanzania, Ghana, and Côte d'Ivoire, Jumia Food (formerly Hellofood before 
rebranding in 2016) specifically addresses challenges unique to African urban environments 
including fragmented restaurant landscapes, limited address syste ms, variable internet 
connectivity, and diverse payment preferences including strong mobile money adoption.  
In Kenya specifically, Jumia Food serves Nairobi, Mombasa, Kisumu, and other major urban 
centers, partnering with hundreds of restaurants ranging fr om international chains to local eateries. 
While primarily focused on restaurant delivery rather than institutional cafeterias, Jumia Food's 
approach to mobile ordering, payment integration, and logistics in African contexts provides 
valuable insights dire ctly applicable to campus dining solutions. The platform processes hundreds 
of thousands of orders monthly across its markets, demonstrating that African consumers embrace 
mobile food ordering when it's properly adapted to local realities.  
Key Features and  African Market Adaptations  
Jumia Food's mobile application and website provide restaurant discovery through location -based 
search, category filtering (cuisine types, price ranges, dietary preferences), and user ratings and 
reviews. The ordering workflow a ccommodates African market realities in several critical ways. 
First, the address system uses landmarks and descriptive locations ("near Yaya Centre," "opposite 
Sarit Centre") rather than relying solely on street addresses, which may be inconsistent or non -
existent in many areas. Customers can save multiple delivery locations with landmarks, and the 
platform includes map integration but doesn't depend exclusively on precise GPS coordinates.  
Payment integration represents Jumia Food's most significant locali zation achievement. The 
platform fully supports M -Pesa, Kenya's dominant mobile money service, as a primary payment 
method alongside cash on delivery and credit/debit cards. This M -Pesa integration is seamless —
customers select M -Pesa at checkout, receive a n STK push prompt on their mobile devices, enter 
their PIN, and payment confirmation happens within seconds. The system also supports Airtel 
Money and other regional mobile money services in markets where they're prevalent. Cash on 
delivery remains popular , accommodating users without smartphones or those preferring cash 
transactions, with delivery personnel equipped to handle exact change.  
The platform optimizes for intermittent connectivity and limited data plans common in African 
markets. The mobile apps  use aggressive data caching, storing restaurant menus, images, and user 
preferences locally so browsing works even with poor connectivity. Order placement requires 
connectivity but is designed to succeed even on slower 2G/3G networks. Image compression an d 
progressive loading ensure reasonable performance on budget smartphones with limited 
processing power and memory.  

================================================================================
PAGE 19
================================================================================

Jumia Food implements delivery logistics tailored to African urban environments. Rather than 
relying on gig economy delivery models like Ube r Eats, Jumia employs dedicated delivery staff 
(Jumia Food Captains) who know local areas intimately, can navigate areas with poor signage or 
informal settlements, and build relationships with both restaurants and regular customers. Delivery 
fees are trans parently displayed and relatively affordable (typically $0.50 -$2.00 equivalent), 
acknowledging price sensitivity in the market. Real -time order tracking via SMS and in -app 
notifications keeps customers informed even if they're not actively using the app.  
Customer engagement features include favorites, order history for quick reordering, and occasional 
vouchers or discounts distributed via the Jumia app ecosystem. The platform occasionally runs 
promotional campaigns tied to local events, holidays, or paydays  (many Kenyans are paid 
monthly), showing cultural awareness in timing and messaging. Ratings and reviews encourage 
restaurant quality accountability, with Jumia moderating to prevent fake reviews —a common 
concern in markets with emerging e -commerce trust.  
Strengths and Success Factors  
Jumia Food's primary strength is its deep understanding and accommodation of African market 
realities. The M -Pesa integration isn't an afterthought —it's a core payment method prominently 
featured and optimized for speed and r eliability. The platform doesn't assume consistent internet 
connectivity or unlimited data but designs for intermittent access. Address systems work with how 
Africans actually describe locations rather than imposing Western assumptions about street 
address es. 
The investment in dedicated delivery staff rather than purely gig models provides reliability and 
service quality that builds customer trust. Delivery personnel become familiar faces in 
neighborhoods, understand local geography including informal paths  and shortcuts, and can 
communicate with customers in local languages when needed. This human -centric approach, while 
more costly than pure technology solutions, proves essential in markets where trust and personal 
relationships matter.  
Jumia's broader eco system creates synergies —users familiar with ordering physical products from 
Jumia.com find food ordering intuitive, shared payment accounts and addresses reduce friction, 
and cross -promotional opportunities exist. The company's significant venture capital  funding (over 
$400 million raised across Jumia Group) provides resources for sustained market development, 
technology refinement, and customer acquisition even while working toward profitability.  
Limitations and Challenges  
Despite successes, Jumia Food fa ces ongoing challenges reflecting broader African e -commerce 
difficulties. Profitability remains elusive —Jumia Group reported substantial losses in recent years 
as it balances growth investment against unit economics. High customer acquisition costs, inten se 
competition from both local startups and global platforms entering African markets, and price -

================================================================================
PAGE 20
================================================================================

sensitive customers limit pricing power. Restaurant commission rates (typically 20 -30% per order) 
create tension with partners, some of whom view the platform as necessary but expensive.  
Logistics costs in African cities are high due to traffic congestion, fuel prices, and the need for 
delivery to dispersed locations rather than dense urban cores. Delivery timeframes (often 45 -90 
minutes) are longer than custome rs accustomed to Western food delivery expect, though 
reasonable given local conditions. Order accuracy and restaurant quality control remain 
challenges —negative reviews often cite incorrect orders or food quality issues, reflecting difficulty 
in enforcing  standards across hundreds of partner restaurants.  
The platform is optimized for individual consumer restaurant ordering rather than institutional or 
campus environments. Features relevant to cafeteria contexts —meal plans, institutional payment 
system inte gration, nutritional information, batch ordering for events —are absent. The business 
model assumes per -order commissions from restaurants rather than institutional licensing or 
partnerships, making it economically unsuitable for campus deployment without s ignificant 
modification.  
2.3.2 Glovo (Kenya/East Africa Expansion)  
Overview  
Glovo, founded in Barcelona in 2015 and rapidly expanding globally, entered the Kenyan market 
in 2020, representing the entry of European on -demand delivery platforms into East Afr ica. 
Operating as a multi -category delivery service (food, groceries, pharmaceuticals, documents, and 
more), Glovo positions itself as the "anything" platform rather than exclusively food delivery. In 
Kenya, Glovo serves Nairobi and surrounding areas, comp eting with Jumia Food, Uber Eats 
(which entered then exited the market), and local players like Yum Deliveries.  
Glovo's relevance to this literature review stems from its approach to localizing a European 
technology platform for African markets, its gig economy delivery model adapted to local context, 
and its efforts to build sustainability in a challenging market. While not campus -specific, Glovo's 
strategies for user acquisition, payment integration, and operational efficiency in resource -
constrained en vironments offer lessons applicable to institutional dining solutions.  
Features and Market Approach  
Glovo's mobile application provides a unified interface for ordering across multiple product 
categories. For food specifically, users browse restaurants by cuisine, sort by delivery time or 
rating, and place orders similar to other delivery platforms. The hybrid inventory model is 
distinctive —some restaurants operate on a marketplace model (restaurant prepares food, Glovo 
delivers) while others are "Glovo kit chens" (dark kitchens operated by Glovo or partners optimized 
for delivery).  
Payment integration reflects African realities with M -Pesa as a primary option alongside cash and 
cards. Glovo's M -Pesa implementation is robust, with the STK push process optimiz ed for minimal 

================================================================================
PAGE 21
================================================================================

steps. The platform also supports partial payment splits (pay partly with Glovo credit, partly with 
M-Pesa), accommodating users managing limited budgets. Glovo Prime, a subscription service 
offering unlimited free delivery for a monthly fee  (approximately $3.99), represents an attempt to 
build recurring revenue and customer loyalty —a model relatively novel in African food delivery.  
The gig economy delivery model uses independent couriers ("Glovers") who operate flexibly, 
similar to Uber driv ers. Couriers use personal motorcycles or bicycles, receive orders through a 
courier app, and earn per delivery plus tips. This model provides income flexibility appealing in 
markets with high unemployment, though it raises questions about labor rights and  income 
stability. Glovo provides minimal equipment (branded delivery bags) but couriers bear most 
operational costs (fuel, maintenance, smartphone data).  
Real-time tracking, in -app chat with couriers, and customer support via WhatsApp and phone 
represent Glovo's emphasis on transparency and communication. The WhatsApp integration is 
particularly notable —recognizing WhatsApp's dominance in Kenya for business communication, 
Glovo offers customer support and order updates via the platform familiar to users. M arketing 
leverages social media heavily, particularly Instagram and Twitter, aligning with how young urban 
Kenyans discover services.  
Strengths and Competitive Positioning  
Glovo's multi -category approach creates more frequent use cases than food -only platf orms. A user 
might order lunch, then later use Glovo for grocery delivery or pharmacy items, increasing 
engagement and spreading customer acquisition costs across more transactions. The dark kitchen 
model improves delivery speed and consistency for popular  items, though it shifts Glovo from 
pure marketplace to direct food service operator with different operational demands and risks.  
The gig economy courier model provides operational flexibility —Glovo scales courier supply up 
during peak demand without carr ying fixed labor costs. In markets with abundant labor and limited 
formal employment opportunities, courier roles provide accessible income despite lacking 
traditional employment benefits. Technology -enabled routing and courier allocation optimize 
efficien cy, though effectiveness depends on reliable connectivity and GPS in areas with poor 
infrastructure.  
Glovo Prime represents an innovative attempt at building customer lock -in and predictable revenue 
through subscriptions. If successful (data on adoption ra tes is not publicly available for Kenya), 
this model reduces per -transaction customer acquisition costs and encourages higher order 
frequency. The low price point ($3.99/month) acknowledges price sensitivity while still creating 
switching costs for custome rs who subscribe.  
Limitations and Market Challenges  
Glovo entered the Kenyan market during COVID -19, benefiting from accelerated delivery 
adoption but also facing economic constraints from pandemic impacts. Profitability remains 

================================================================================
PAGE 22
================================================================================

distant —Glovo's global oper ations report losses as the company prioritizes growth and market 
share. The Kenyan market specifically is highly competitive, with low barriers to entry enabling 
numerous local competitors and global platforms evaluating or entering the space.  
The gig eco nomy labor model, while operationally flexible for Glovo, creates income instability 
for couriers who bear fuel costs, equipment depreciation, and accident risks without employment 
protections or benefits. Courier complaints about low pay per delivery, lac k of tips, and 
exploitation have emerged across Glovo's markets, creating reputational risks and potential 
regulatory attention as African governments begin scrutinizing gig economy labor practices.  
Delivery reliability and timing remain challenges in Nair obi's traffic -congested environment. 
Promised delivery windows often extend or miss, frustrating customers. The multi -category model 
sometimes creates capacity allocation issues (should couriers prioritize a food order or a pharmacy 
delivery?), and mixing food with non -food items in delivery bags raises hygiene concerns despite 
official separation policies.  
Like Jumia Food, Glovo is designed for consumer restaurant delivery rather than institutional 
cafeteria contexts. The platform lacks features for meal p lan integration, student identification, 
batch ordering for campus events, or nutritional tracking. The commission structure (typically 25 -
30% on food orders) suits restaurants but wouldn't translate directly to campus dining operations 
with different econ omic models.  
2.4 Local Perspective  
2.4.1 Current University Cafeteria Operations in Kenya (Traditional Model)  
Overview  
To understand the local context for campus dining technology implementation, it is essential to 
examine the current state of cafeteria op erations at Kenyan universities. Most institutions, 
including the University of Nairobi (UoN), Kenyatta University, Jomo Kenyatta University of 
Agriculture and Technology (JKUAT), and numerous private universities, continue to operate 
cafeterias using pred ominantly traditional, manual ordering and service models. While a few 
institutions have begun exploring digital solutions, the vast majority rely on face -to-face ordering, 
cash payments, and manual record -keeping —the baseline against which any proposed di gital 
transformation must be measured.  
A typical Kenyan university cafeteria operates during defined meal periods (breakfast 7:00 -9:00 
AM, lunch 12:00 -3:00 PM, dinner 6:00 -8:00 PM) with peak congestion occurring immediately 
after morning and afternoon clas ses end. Cafeterias at major universities serve hundreds to 
thousands of students daily, with serving capacity often lagging behind enrollment growth. 
Physical infrastructure varies —some institutions have modern, well -equipped cafeterias while 
others opera te in aging facilities with limited seating, inadequate ventilation, and insufficient 
service points.  

================================================================================
PAGE 23
================================================================================

Operational Model and Student Experience  
The standard ordering process requires students to physically queue at service counters manned 
by cafeteria staff . Menus are typically displayed on wall -mounted boards with items and prices 
listed in chalk or whiteboard markers, though items may be crossed out when unavailable without 
advance notice to students in line. Menu options usually include staple foods (ugal i, rice, chapati), 
protein options (beef, chicken, beans), vegetable sides (sukuma wiki, cabbage), and beverages (tea, 
sodas, juice). Pricing is relatively affordable compared to off -campus restaurants, reflecting 
institutional subsidies and the captive ma rket, with typical meals ranging from Ksh 80 -200 ($0.60 -
$1.50 USD equivalent).  
Students communicate orders verbally to serving staff, who manually portion food from large 
cooking pots or steam trays. Portion control is  
inconsistent, varying based on time o f day (earlier customers often receive larger portions before 
food runs low), specific server, and sometimes interpersonal relationships between staff and 
regular customers. No standardized nutritional information is provided, and students with specific 
dietary needs or allergies must verbally inquire about ingredients, relying on serving staff's 
knowledge which may be incomplete.  
Payment occurs at a separate cashier station after food is received, creating a two -queue system 
(ordering queue, then payment q ueue). Cash is the predominant payment method, with most 
cafeterias accepting Kenyan Shillings only. Some institutional cafeterias accept student ID cards 
preloaded with funds (similar to declining balance accounts), though adoption varies widely and 
reloa ding these accounts often requires visiting specific offices during limited hours, creating its 
own friction. Mobile money (M -Pesa) acceptance is inconsistent —some cafeterias accept it 
informally while others explicitly require cash due to concerns about t ransaction costs or 
accounting complexity.  
Wait times during peak hours regularly extend to 20 -40 minutes encompassing queuing, ordering, 
payment, and finding seating. This time investment becomes particularly problematic for students 
with back -to-back cla sses or those traveling from distant parts of large campuses. Many students 
report skipping meals entirely when queues appear excessive, opting instead for quick snacks from 
campus kiosks or going hungry until returning home after classes. The physical cro wding and 
noise during peak periods create stressful dining experiences inconsistent with ideal campus 
environments.  
Operational Challenges for Cafeteria Management  
From the cafeteria operators' perspective, the traditional model presents significant manag ement 
challenges. Inventory forecasting relies on historical patterns and staff intuition rather than data -
driven demand prediction. This results in frequent stockouts of popular items, forcing last -minute 
substitutions that disappoint customers, or over -preparation leading to food waste and financial 

================================================================================
PAGE 24
================================================================================

losses. Without order pre -placement, demand appears suddenly when classes end, creating chaotic 
kitchen conditions and rushed food preparation that may compromise quality.  
Financial management is complex and error -prone. Cash handling requires careful counting, 
secure storage, daily reconciliation, and transportation to banks —all introducing opportunities for 
theft or accounting errors. Revenue attribution to specific menu items is estimated rather  than 
precisely known, making it difficult to identify profitable versus unprofitable offerings or optimize 
menu design for financial performance. Labor scheduling is inefficient, with staffing levels often 
mismatched to actual demand patterns because thos e patterns aren't quantified with precision.  
Customer feedback mechanisms are nearly non -existent in most traditional operations. Complaint 
boxes may be placed in cafeterias but are rarely monitored proactively, and anonymous complaints 
are difficult to in vestigate or address. There's no systematic way to identify trends in customer 
satisfaction, popular versus disliked items, or service quality issues that might be correctable if 
promptly identified. Management operates with limited visibility into the act ual student experience 
beyond occasional informal observations.  
Emerging Digital Initiatives  
A small number of Kenyan universities have begun exploring digital solutions, though 
implementations remain limited and often partial. Some initiatives include:  
WhatsApp ordering groups where students send orders via text to cafeteria staff who prepare meals 
for scheduled pickup, eliminating queuing but introducing manual coordination overhead and 
scaling challenges. This model works for small user groups but breaks  down at scale.  
Mobile money (M -Pesa) payment acceptance, either formally integrated through till numbers or 
informally through staff personal numbers. This addresses payment convenience but doesn't solve 
ordering efficiency, menu visibility, or data colle ction challenges.  
Student portal integrations where meal account balances can be checked online and possibly 
topped up, though the actual ordering and service delivery remains manual. These represent 
incremental improvements in financial transparency witho ut transforming the core dining 
experience.  
These emerged initiatives demonstrate student and institutional recognition that digital 
transformation could improve campus dining, but the lack of comprehensive solutions indicates 
gaps in available platforms s uited to the Kenyan university context —gaps that the proposed 
Cafeteria Ordering and Loyalty Reward System aims to address.  
2.4.2 Strathmore University Dining Services (Digital Adaptation Example)  
Overview  
Strathmore University, a private institution in Na irobi known for technology adoption and 
innovation, represents one of the few Kenyan universities that has implemented elements of digital 

================================================================================
PAGE 25
================================================================================

dining services, making it a valuable local case study. While not a complete mobile ordering 
solution comparable to t he global systems reviewed earlier, Strathmore's approach demonstrates 
both the possibilities and the current limitations of campus dining digitalization in the Kenyan 
context.  
Strathmore operates multiple dining facilities on its main Nairobi campus inclu ding a primary 
cafeteria, coffee shops, and grab -and-go locations. The university has approximately 4,000 -5,000 
students (undergraduate and graduate) creating substantial daily dining demand, particularly 
during the lunch hours between 12:00 -2:00 PM when c lass schedules create concentrated traffic.  
Digital Systems and Features  
Strathmore's dining services utilize a student ID card system integrated with the university's 
broader campus services platform. Students load funds onto their ID cards (Strathmore Ca rd) at 
designated points or through online portal payment systems accepting M -Pesa or bank transfers. 
The card balance then functions as a declining balance account usable across campus services 
including cafeteria purchases, library printing, vending mach ines, and access control.  
At the point of sale, students tap their ID cards on card readers connected to the cafeteria's point -
of-sale system. The system automatically deducts the purchase amount, provides electronic 
receipts, and tracks transactions for b oth student account management and cafeteria business 
analytics. This cashless payment approach eliminates physical cash handling time, improves 
transaction speed at busy times, and reduces theft or error risks associated with cash management.  
The universi ty provides a student portal and mobile app where students can check card balances, 
view transaction history, and initiate top -ups remotely. This financial transparency helps students 
budget and avoid unexpected insufficient fund situations. Automated low -balance email/SMS 
alerts remind students to top up before running out —a thoughtful feature addressing the frustration 
of reaching the cafeteria payment point only to discover insufficient funds.  
For cafeteria management, the system generates detailed sales  analytics including revenue by 
day/week/month, popular items, peak transaction times, and individual transaction records. This 
data visibility enables more informed decision -making about inventory ordering, menu planning, 
and staffing allocation during pe ak periods. Financial reconciliation is simplified through 
automated systems reducing manual accounting labor.  
Strengths and Positive Outcomes  
The cashless payment system significantly speeds transactions compared to cash handling, 
particularly during peak  hours when seconds per transaction multiply across hundreds of students. 
Card tap payments typically complete in 2 -3 seconds versus 10 -20+ seconds for cash transactions 
requiring counting, change -making, and verification. This throughput improvement mater ially 
reduces queue wait times even without other operational changes.  

================================================================================
PAGE 26
================================================================================

Students report appreciating the convenience of not needing to carry cash specifically for cafeteria 
purchases, the ability to top up remotely, and the financial tracking that helps bud get management. 
The transparency of seeing exact charges discourages the unethical practice of staff overcharging 
that can occur in manual cash systems. Parents can remotely load funds onto student cards, 
ensuring students have meal access even if personal  finances are constrained temporarily.  
From the institutional perspective, the integrated card system creates operational efficiencies 
across multiple services (one card for dining, library, access control, etc.), improves financial 
controls and audit trai ls, and provides data for campus planning. The reduced cash handling 
improves staff safety (less cash on premises reducing robbery risk) and eliminates the costs of 
daily bank deposits.  
Limitations and Unaddressed Needs  
Despite these strengths, Strathmore' s system addresses only payment convenience —ordering, 
menu visibility, wait time management, and customer engagement remain manual and traditional. 
Students still queue to view menus, communicate orders verbally, wait for preparation, and then 
process paym ent. The core bottleneck of sequential ordering at limited service points persists. 
During very busy periods, the faster payment processing provides only marginal wait time 
reduction because order communication and preparation consume the majority of servi ce time.  
No mobile ordering functionality exists —students cannot browse menus, customize orders, or 
place orders for scheduled pickup from their smartphones. No loyalty or rewards program 
incentivizes repeat business or provides recognition to frequent din ers. No nutritional information 
is digitally available for students managing dietary needs. No real -time menu availability updates 
inform students which items are in stock before they reach the service counter.  
The system serves payment and financial manag ement but doesn't transform the fundamental 
dining experience or create the advanced capabilities seen in the global systems reviewed earlier 
(Grubhub Campus, CBORD GET). Its existence demonstrates Kenyan university readiness for 
digital dining services an d provides a foundation (student ID cards, payment infrastructure) upon 
which more comprehensive solutions could build, but significant functionality gaps remain —gaps 
that the proposed Cafeteria Ordering and Loyalty Reward System is designed to address 
comprehensively.

Common Strengths Across Successful Systems  
Mobile -First Design Philosophy  
All successful modern systems prioritize mobile user experience, recognizing  that students prefer 
smartphone interfaces over web portals or physical interactions. Native iOS and Android 
applications provide superior performance, offline capabilities, and integration with device 
features (notifications, location services, camera fo r QR codes) compared to mobile web solutions. 
Progressive web apps (PWAs) offer a middle ground for institutions with limited development 
resources.  
Payment Integration Flexibility  

================================================================================
PAGE 30
================================================================================

Systems that succeed in their respective markets offer multiple payment met hods aligned with 
local preferences. In North America, this means credit/debit cards and meal plan integration; in 
Africa, M -Pesa and mobile money are essential; globally, digital wallets (Apple Pay, Google Pay) 
increasingly matter to tech -savvy users. The  common principle is reducing payment friction by 
meeting users where they already transact rather than requiring new payment setup.  
Real-Time Information and Transparency  
Successful platforms provide real -time visibility into order status,estimated wait t imes, menu 
availability, and account balances. This transparency reduces uncertainty that frustrates users in 
manual systems where they invest time queuing without knowing if desired items remain available 
or how long service will take. Push notifications keep users informed proactively rather than 
requiring constant app checking.  
Data -Driven Operations Enablement  
Platforms that provide analytics dashboards transform cafeteria management from intuition -based 
to evidence -based. Understanding which items sell  when, what price points optimize revenue, and 
how demand fluctuates enables better inventory planning, menu design, labor scheduling, and 
financial management. The compounding benefit of data -driven decisions justifies technology 
adoption costs over time.  
Common Weaknesses and Limitations  
High Implementation and Operating Costs  
Nearly all professional campus dining platforms involve substantial costs —licensing fees, 
implementation services, ongoing support, transaction fees, and integration dependencies. These 
costs suit large, well -funded universities in developed markets but create barriers for smaller 
institutions, particularly in developing countries where per -student technology budgets are 
constrained. The value proposition depends on sc ale—benefits only exceed costs when serving 
thousands of users.  
Limited Applicability Across Different Contexts  
Systems designed for North American campuses make assumptions about infrastructure (reliable 
electricity and internet, ubiquitous credit cards, street address systems) that don't hold in African 
contexts. Conversely, consumer food delivery platforms optimized for African markets lack 
institutional features (meal plans, nutritional tracking, educational discounts) needed in university 
settings. Few  solutions successfully bridge these contexts without substantial customization.  
Sustainability of Gig Economy Labor Models  
Platforms using gig economy delivery (courier apps like Glovo) face increasing scrutiny regarding 
labor practices, worker income sta bility, and social responsibility. The flexibility that attracts 
workers and benefits platforms simultaneously creates income uncertainty, lack of benefits, and 

================================================================================
PAGE 31
================================================================================

potential exploitation that may face regulatory restrictions or reputational damage. Alternativ e 
models (employed delivery staff like Jumia) have better labor outcomes but higher fixed costs 
challenging profitability.  
Vendor Dependency and Lock -In 
Institutions adopting third -party platforms (Grubhub Campus, CBORD GET) accept dependency 
on those vend ors for ongoing support, feature development, and business continuity. If vendors 
raise prices, reduce support quality, or exit markets, institutions face difficult choices between 
accepting degraded service or undertaking costly migrations to alternatives . Proprietary data 
formats and closed systems prevent easy transitions, creating vendor lock -in that reduces 
institutional control.  
Identified Gaps and Opportunities  
Affordable, Campus -Specific Solutions for Emerging Markets  
A significant gap exists for ca mpus dining technology designed specifically for African or 
developing market universities with limited budgets but genuine needs for operational efficiency 
and student experience improvements. Such solutions must integrate M -Pesa and local payment 
methods , handle intermittent connectivity gracefully, run on budget smartphones, and operate at 
price points (perhaps $5,000 -$15,000 annually or even lower through open -source approaches) 
accessible to resource -constrained institutions.  
Integration of Loyalty/Rew ards with Ordering  
While commercial food delivery appsoften include rudimentary rewards (discount codes, 
occasional promotions), and some campus systems offer isolated loyalty features, few 
comprehensively integrate loyalty point accrual, redemption, tiere d benefits, and personalized 
engagement within the core ordering experience. The opportunity exists to drive repeat business 
and customer affinity through well -designed loyalty programs that reward frequent cafeteria 
users —particularly valuable in campus e nvironments where customer lifetime value extends 
across multiple years.  
Nutritional Information and Health Integration  
Global campus solutions like CBORD emphasize nutrition, but African market systems generally 
don't. Few platforms bridge this gap —provid ing detailed nutritional data, dietary filtering, health 
goal tracking, and personalized recommendations optimized for both developed and developing 
market contexts where nutritional priorities may differ (addressing both over -nutrition in wealthy 
segments  and under -nutrition in constrained ones).  
Sustainable, Appropriate Technology Solutions  
An opportunity exists for solutions balancing technological sophistication with appropriate 
complexity for their context. Over -engineered solutions waste resources and  create maintenance 

================================================================================
PAGE 32
================================================================================

burdens; under -engineered solutions fail to deliver value. Finding the appropriate middle ground —
cloud -based where infrastructure supports it, offline -capable where connectivity is unreliable, 
feature -rich where users value complexity, streamlined where simplicity matters —tailored to 
specific institutional contexts represents a design challenge few existing platforms address 
comprehensively.  
The proposed Cafeteria Ordering and Loyalty Reward System aims to address these identified 
gaps b y combining successful patterns from global campus solutions (mobile ordering, analytics, 
institutional integration) with African market adaptations (M -Pesa, intermittent connectivity 
handling, affordability focus) within a loyalty -integrated platform spec ifically designed for the 
Kenyan university context at accessible cost points for medium -sized private and public 
institutions.  
2.6 Conclusion  
This literature review has systematically examined mobile food ordering and campus dining 
systems across global, regional, and local perspectives to establish the theoretical and practical 
foundation for the proposed Cafeteria Ordering and Loyalty Reward System. The analysis reveals 
both the maturity of digital dining solutions in developed markets and the significan t opportunities 
for contextually appropriate implementations in emerging markets, particularly within Kenyan 
university environments.  
The global perspective demonstrated that mobile campus dining technology is well -established 
and proven. Systems like Grub hub Campus and CBORD GET Mobile serve hundreds of 
universities, processing millions of orders annually with sophisticated features including menu 
customization, nutritional tracking, meal plan integration, scheduled pickup, and comprehensive 
analytics. The se platforms validate that students enthusiastically adopt mobile ordering when it 
provides genuine convenience advantages —eliminating wait times, enabling schedule flexibility, 
offering transparency, and delivering polished user experiences. The technical  architectures 
(cloud -based backends, native mobile applications, API integrations with institutional systems, 
real-time order processing) provide blueprints for robust, scalable implementations.  
However, the global systems also reveal significant limitati ons when considering deployment in 
different contexts. High costs ($30,000 -$100,000+ annually for licensing and implementation) 
make them economically prohibitive for most Kenyan universities. Technology assumptions 
(ubiquitous internet connectivity, credi t card payment dominance, street address systems) don't 
align with African realities. The vendor dependency inherent in third -party platform adoption 
creates sustainability risks for institutions. These limitations necessitate alternative approaches 
rather  than direct adoption of existing global solutions.  
The regional perspective highlighted how successful platforms adapt to African market realities. 
Jumia Food's deep M -Pesa integration, handling of intermittent connectivity through aggressive 
data caching , landmark -based addressing systems, and mixed payment options (mobile money, 

================================================================================
PAGE 33
================================================================================

cash, cards) demonstrate sophisticated localization going far beyond simple translation. Glovo's 
WhatsApp integration for customer support, use of gig economy delivery adapted to  local labor 
markets, and subscription pricing models represent further adaptations. These African platforms 
prove that African consumers embrace mobile ordering when solutions genuinely accommodate 
rather than ignore contextual factors.  
Yet the regional s ystems focus on consumer restaurant delivery rather than institutional cafeteria 
environments, leaving a functionality gap. Features essential to campus dining —meal plan 
integration, student identification, batch ordering for events, nutritional tracking a ligned with 
educational health initiatives, institutional analytics for operational planning —are absent from 
consumer delivery platforms. The business models (commission -based revenue from restaurants, 
per-delivery fees) don't translate directly to campus contexts where cafeterias operate as services 
rather than profit -maximizing businesses.  
The local perspective grounded the review in the specific realities of Kenyan university cafeterias. 
The examination of traditional manual operations documented substan tial pain points: 20 -40 
minute wait times during peak hours, cash -heavy payment systems creating inefficiencies and 
risks, absence of nutritional information, lack of customer data preventing informed management 
decisions, and overall student dissatisfacti on reflected in meal skipping and complaints. The 
Strathmore University case study demonstrated that Kenyan students readily adopt digital dining 
services (cashless ID card payments) when implemented, validating market readiness while 
simultaneously highli ghting that payment alone doesn't transform the complete dining 
experience —mobile ordering, loyalty, engagement, and analytics remain unaddressed even in the 
most digitally progressive Kenyan institutions.  
The comparative analysis synthesized these finding s into a clear gap identification. Successful 
campus dining technology exists but is too costly and contextually mismatched for most Kenyan 
universities. African food delivery platforms handle local payment and connectivity realities but 
lack campus -specif ic functionality. Traditional cafeteria operations are affordable but deliver poor 
student experiences and limited operational intelligence. Strathmore's payment digitalization 
shows promise but represents only partial transformation.  
The opportunity —and t he justification for this project —lies in developing a solution that combines 
the best elements of these various approaches: the mobile ordering and analytics capabilities of 
global campus platforms, the M -Pesa integration and connectivity resilience of Af rican food 
delivery platforms, the institutional integration demonstrated by Strathmore, and an cost structure 
accessible to resource -constrained institutions. By adding integrated loyalty rewards as a 
differentiator addressing the identified gap in custom er engagement, the proposed Cafeteria 
Ordering and Loyalty Reward System aims to deliver comprehensive digital transformation 
appropriate to the Kenyan university context.  
The subsequent chapters build upon this foundation. Chapter 3 defines specific, meas urable 
objectives aligned with addressing the problems documented in Chapter 1 and achieving 

================================================================================
PAGE 34
================================================================================

capabilities exemplified by the systems reviewed in this chapter. Chapter 4 outlines the project 
methodology and implementation approach informed by best practices  identified across the 
reviewed systems. Chapters 5 -7 document the system design, implementation, and evaluation, 
incorporating lessons learned from both successes and failures of the platforms examined in this 
literature review.

3 CHAPTER THREE: AIMS AND OBJECTIVES  
3.1 Introduction  
A successful research or system development project requires a clear sense of direction, which can 
only be achieved through well -defined aims and objectives. These act as the guiding framework 
that shapes the overall purpose of the study, the methods adopted, and the outcomes expected. 
Without properly established aims and objectives, projects risk deviating from their intended 
purpose, resulting in inefficiency and lack of focus.  
 
In the context of this study, which seeks to address the challenges of cafeteria ordering and 
customer engagement at university campuses in Kenya, the aims and objectives provide the 
foundation for ensuring that the proposed solution directly responds to the problems identi fied in 
the earlier chapters. The introduction of a mobile -based cafeteria ordering and loyalty reward 
system requires not only a broad aim that captures the overall vision of the project but also specific 
objectives that outline the practical steps necess ary to realize this vision.  
 
This section therefore introduces the general aim of the study and breaks it down into specific 
objectives that will guide the design, development, testing, and documentation of the system. 
Together, they serve as a structured roadmap that ensures the project achieves its intended goals in 
a systematic and measurable manner.  
 3.2 General Aims and Objectives  
 
The general aim of this project is to design, develop, and evaluate a mobile -based 
cafeteria ordering system with AI -power ed chatbot specifically for university campuses 
in Kenya. This initiative seeks to directly address the documented inefficiencies and 
challenges faced by students and cafeteria staff, including long queue wait times, 
manual ordering processes, limited paym ent options, and lack of intelligent customer 
support. By moving beyond traditional cash -based, queue -dependent operations, the 
project aims to provide a reliable, user -friendly, AI -enhanced digital solution. Ultimately, 
this endeavor contributes to the br oader strategic goals of enhancing campus dining 
services and driving digital transformation, thereby improving student welfare and 
institutional efficiency.  
A comprehensive review of existing literature will be conducted to establish a strong 
theoretical and practical foundation for this project. This survey will critically analyze 
prior research on mobile ordering systems, digital payment integration, and AI chatbot 
implementations, with a specific focus on their application within educational and 

================================================================================
PAGE 36
================================================================================

hospita lity environments. It will investigate common technological approaches, such as 
the use of mobile applications, cloud -based databases (Firebase), mobile money APIs 
(M-Pesa Daraja), natural language processing (NLP) for chatbots, and push notification 
syste ms, and evaluate their respective strengths and limitations. Furthermore, the 
literature review will identify and synthesize the key usability principles, user interface 
(UI) design patterns, and user experience (UX) criteria that are most critical for the  
success of similar applications. This process will ensure the project is informed by 
established best practices and helps to clearly define the research gap that this specific, 
AI-enhanced solution for Kenyan university cafeterias will fill.  
The design an d development of the application will be guided by a structured 
architectural framework to ensure robustness and usability. The system will be 
conceptualized with a clear separation between the mobile application (frontend), cloud 
backend infrastructure, A I chatbot service, and administrative interfaces. The backend, 
built using Firebase, will be responsible for managing core data including user accounts, 
menu items, orders, transactions, and chatbot conversation logs. The mobile application, 
developed usin g Flutter for cross -platform compatibility, will feature an intuitive 
interface designed for ease of use. Key functionalities to be implemented include menu 
browsing with images and prices, shopping cart management, order placement with 
customization optio ns, M -Pesa payment integration, AI -powered chatbot for customer 
support and personalized menu recommendations, real -time order tracking, and push 
notifications. An administrative web dashboard will enable cafeteria staff to manage 
incoming orders, update m enu items, and access analytics. The design process will 
prioritize a user -centered approach, ensuring the final product addresses the specific 
needs of both students and cafeteria management.  
The final phase of the project will involve rigorous testing an d evaluation of the 
developed prototype to validate its effectiveness and readiness for deployment. The 
testing regimen will encompass both technical performance and user acceptance. 
Technically, the application will be assessed for the accuracy of its ord er processing, the 
reliability of payment transactions, chatbot response accuracy and helpfulness, response 
time performance, and overall system stability. For user -centric evaluation, a group of 
representative users (minimum 15 students) will be recruited  to participate in usability 
tests and provide feedback through structured surveys. Key metrics such as task 
completion time, error rates, chatbot interaction satisfaction, user satisfaction scores, 
and willingness to adopt the system will be collected and  analyzed. The insights gained 
from this comprehensive evaluation will be used to refine the application and 
demonstrate the extent to which it meets its core objective of improving the cafeteria 
ordering experience through intelligent automation.

 3.3 Sp ecific Aims and Objectives  
The specific aims and objectives of this project are to:  
1. Conduct a literature survey on existing mobile ordering systems, digital payment 
integration (M -Pesa), and AI chatbot implementations in order to identify their 
strengths a nd weaknesses.  
2. Design and develop a mobile cafeteria ordering system with AI chatbot that 
provides menu browsing, shopping cart management, order placement, M -Pesa 
payment integration, AI -powered chatbot for customer support and menu 
recommendations, real -time order tracking with push notifications, and an 
administrative dashboard, with a secure and scalable Firebase -based architecture.  
3. Test and evaluate the prototype cafeteria ordering system with minimum 15 
student users in order to assess the extent to w hich it resolves the issues of long 
queues, manual processes, limited payment options, and lack of customer 
engagement identified above.  
3.4 Conclusion  
This chapter has outlined the aims and objectives that will guide the development of the 
proposed cafeteria ordering system with AI -powered chatbot for university campuses in 
Kenya. The general aim of the study was established as the creation of a mobile -based 
solution to address the inefficiencies and challenges of traditional cafeteria opera tions, 
including long queues, manual processes, limited payment options, and lack of 
intelligent customer support. This broad aim was then broken down into specific 
objectives that focus on conducting a literature review to identify best practices in 
mobil e ordering and AI chatbot implementations, designing and developing a 
comprehensive mobile ordering system with M -Pesa integration and AI chatbot 
capabilities, and testing and evaluating the prototype with actual student users.  
The formulation of these aim s and objectives provides a structured roadmap for the 
project. They ensure that each stage of the research and development process remains 
aligned with the central problems identified in Chapter One while also laying the 
groundwork for the practical desig n and implementation strategies to follow in Chapter 
Four. Furthermore, the objectives highlight the project's emphasis on user -centered 
design, technical robustness through cloud -based architecture and AI integration, and 
innovation through intelligent cu stomer support, ensuring that the final solution is both 
effective and adaptable to the specific needs of university cafeteria operations in the 
Kenyan context.

4 CHAPTER FOUR: PROPOSED PROJECT  
4.1 Introduction  
The Cafeteria Ordering and Loyalty Reward S ystem represents a comprehensive digital 
transformation of campus dining services, addressing the problems documented in Chapter 1 
through a mobile -first solution that integrates ordering, payment, and customer engagement within 
a unified platform. This ch apter outlines the proposed approach to developing this system, 
detailing the project phases, timeline, resource requirements, and risk management strategies that 
will guide implementation from conception through deployment and evaluation.  
The project adop ts an agile, iterative development methodology appropriate for a solo academic 
project with a 10 -week timeline. Rather than attempting to build all features simultaneously, 
development will proceed through three clearly defined phases: Research and Design (Weeks 1 -
3), Development and Implementation (Weeks 4 -8), and Testing and Evaluation (Weeks 9 -10). Each 
phase has specific deliverables and success criteria, ensuring measurable progress throughout the 
project period and enabling early identification of cha llenges requiring adjustment.  
The technical approach centers on modern, cross -platform mobile development using  Flutter, 
Google's UI toolkit for building natively compiled applications from a single codebase. This 
strategic choice enables development of a high-quality mobile application for both iOS and 
Android platforms simultaneously, maximizing potential user reach while minimizing 
development effort —critical for a solo developer within an academic timeline. Flutter's hot reload 
functionality accelerates  development iterations, extensive widget library simplifies UI creation, 
and strong integration with Firebase provides backend infrastructure without requiring separate 
server development.  
The backend infrastructure leverages  Firebase, Google's comprehens ive mobile and web 
application development platform, providing cloud -hosted database (Cloud Firestore), user 
authentication, cloud functions for serverless logic, and cloud storage —all managed services 
requiring no server administration, perfectly suited t o academic project constraints. Payment 
processing integrates  M-Pesa through the Daraja API, enabling mobile money transactions 
essential for Kenyan student adoption. The administrative dashboard will be developed as a 
responsive web application using  Reac t or Next.js, providing cafeteria staff with order 
management and analytics capabilities accessible from any device.  
This technology stack balances sophistication with pragmatism. All core tools are free for 
educational use or offer generous free tiers suf ficient for a university cafeteria: Firebase Spark Plan 
supports development and small -scale deployment at no cost, Flutter framework and development 
tools are open -source and free, M -Pesa Daraja sandbox environment enables testing without 
transaction cost s, and hosting can leverage free tiers from Vercel or Firebase Hosting. The 
estimated total project cost remains under $50 -100, limited primarily to potential Android Play 

================================================================================
PAGE 39
================================================================================

Store registration ($25 one -time fee) and minimal testing device needs if personal s martphone is 
insufficient.  
The solo developer model, while limiting team dynamics and parallel workstreams, provides 
complete creative control, eliminates coordination overhead, and ensures consistent design vision 
throughout the project. Time allocation r eflects realistic solo development capacity: approximately 
15-20 hours per week across the 10 -week period, totaling 150 -200 hours of development effort. 
This intensity is sustainable within an academic context where this project likely represents a major 
course component but students balance multiple concurrent coursework demands.  
Risk management receives explicit attention through systematic identification of technical, 
operational, and timeline risks with defined mitigation strategies. Key risks include M -Pesa API 
integration complexity, Firebase free tier limitations under load testing, timeline pressure affecting 
quality, and potential user adoption barriers. Each identified risk has associated mitigation 
approaches detailed in Section 4.6, ensuring proa ctive rather than reactive problem -solving.  
The following sections elaborate this project plan with increasing specificity: Section 4.2 outlines 
the three major phases and their objectives; Section 4.3 breaks each phase into detailed activities 
and deliver ables; Section 4.4 presents the week -by-week timeline with milestones and 
dependencies clearly marked; Section 4.5 specifies all required resources organized by category; 
and Section 4.6 analyzes risks systematically with probability and impact assessments  informing 
mitigation priorities.  
4.2 Project Phases  
The project is organized into three sequential phases, each with distinct objectives, activities, and 
deliverables designed to progress systematically from concept to deployed system. This phased 
approach provides structure to the development process, enables checkpoint evaluations ensuring 
quality before proceeding, and accommodates the iterative nature of software development where 
later discoveries may inform refinements to earlier decisions.  
4.2.1 Phase 1: Research, Requirements Gathering, and System Design (Weeks 1 -3) 
Objective: Establish comprehensive understanding of user needs, technical requirements, and 
system architecture before beginning implementation, ensuring development efforts build  the right 
system correctly.  
Duration: 3 weeks (approximately 45 -60 hours of effort)  
Key Activities:  
The first phase begins with completion of background research documented as Chapters 1 -2 of 
this report —understanding the problem space through observation  of current cafeteria operations, 
informal interviews with students and cafet  

================================================================================
PAGE 40
================================================================================

eria staff to validate assumptions, and literature review of existing solutions establishing best 
practices and common pitfalls. This research phase, largely completed concurrent ly with early 
project planning, informs all subsequent design decisions.  
Requirements gathering formalizes user needs into specific, testable system requirements. 
Functional requirements define what the system must do: users shall be able to browse menus, add 
items to cart, place orders, make payments, earn loyalty points, track order status, and view history. 
Non-functional requirements specify quality attributes: performance (menu load time <2 seconds), 
security (encrypted payment information, secure auth entication), usability (intuitive interface 
requiring minimal training), and compatibility (support Android 8.0+, iOS 12+ through Flutter 
compilation). Requirements are documented in a structured format enabling traceability from need 
through implementatio n to testing.  
System design translates requirements into technical architecture. The high -level architecture 
defines major components and their relationships: Flutter mobile application (presentation tier), 
Firebase Cloud Firestore (data tier), M -Pesa Dara ja API (payment integration), and React web 
dashboard (administrative interface). Detailed design specifies data models for users, menu items, 
orders, loyalty points, and transactions; defines API contracts between application and backend 
services; plans d atabase schema including collections, document structures, and indexing strategy; 
and creates UI/UX wireframes for key screens establishing visual hierarchy and user flows before 
coding begins.  
Technology stack finalization occurs during this phase. While Flutter and Firebase are 
predetermined strategic choices, specific decisions about state management approach (Provider, 
Riverpod, or BLoC pattern), navigation framework, UI component libraries, and third -party 
packages require evaluation and selection base d on project needs. A prototype development 
environment is established and configured: Flutter SDK installation, Android Studio or VS Code 
setup with Flutter extensions, Firebase project creation and configuration, Daraja API sandbox 
account registration, and git repository initialization for version control.  
Phase 1 Deliverables:  
• Formalized requirements document with functional and non -functional specifications  
• System architecture diagram showing major components and data flows  
• Database schema design for Cloud Firestore collections  
• UI/UX wireframes for minimum 8 -10 key screens (login, menu browsing, cart, checkout, 
order tracking, profile, loyalty, admin dashboard)  
• Technical specification document detailing technology choices and rationale  
• Configured d evelopment environment ready for coding  
• Chapters 1 -3 of project report (introduction, literature review, objectives)  

================================================================================
PAGE 41
================================================================================

Success Criteria: Design documents are reviewed and approved by project supervisor, wireframes 
validated with potential users showing inter face comprehensibility, development environment 
successfully builds and runs a "Hello World" Flutter application connecting to Firebase.  
4.2.2 Phase 2: Development and Implementation (Weeks 4 -8) 
Objective: Transform design specifications into fully functio nal mobile application and 
administrative dashboard, implementing core features iteratively with continuous testing ensuring 
quality throughout development.  
Key Activities:  
The development phase follows an iterative approach building features incrementally  rather than 
attempting complete implementation before any testing. This reduces risk of late -stage discovery 
of fundamental flaws and enables early user feedback incorporation. Development begins with 
foundational infrastructure: Firebase project configur ation including Firestore security rules, 
authentication setup, and cloud function deployment if needed; basic Flutter project structure 
establishing folder organization, navigation framework, and state management architecture; and 
common UI components (bu ttons, cards, input fields) following consistent design system.  
User authentication implementation provides the entry point: Firebase Authentication integration 
for email/password registration and login, user profile creation in Firestore upon registration , 
session management maintaining logged -in state across app restarts, and basic profile 
viewing/editing functionality. This foundational feature enables all subsequent user -specific 
functionality (order history, loyalty points, personalized preferences).  
Core ordering functionality development proceeds through logical increments. Menu browsing 
displays cafeteria offerings retrieved from Firestore with categories, images, descriptions, and 
prices; search and filtering enable users to find items efficiently. Shopping cart management allows 
adding/removing items, adjusting quantities, viewing subtotals including tax/fees if applicable, 
and applying loyalty point discounts. Order placement captures delivery/pickup preferences, 
special instructions, and scheduled  pickup times, submits orders to Firestore creating order 
documents, and triggers appropriate workflows (staff notifications, inventory updates).  
Payment integration represents the most technically complex component. M -Pesa integration via 
Daraja API requi res: obtaining API credentials and understanding authentication flows (OAuth), 
implementing STK Push for customer -initiated payments where users receive payment prompts 
on their phones, handling payment callbacks confirming transaction success/failure, rec ording 
payment transactions in Firestore linked to orders, and implementing proper error handling for 
network failures, insufficient funds, or timeout scenarios. Sandbox testing with test M -Pesa wallets 
validates payment flows before any real money transac tions.  
Loyalty points system implementation tracks earned points (automated when payments complete), 
displays point balances in user profiles, enables point redemption creating discounts on orders, and 

================================================================================
PAGE 42
================================================================================

establishes points expiration policies if required. Or der tracking functionality shows real -time 
order status progression (Received → Preparing → Ready), sends push notifications on status 
changes using Firebase Cloud Messaging, and provides order history viewing with reorder 
capability for convenience.  
The a dministrative dashboard development creates web interface for cafeteria staff: order queue 
display showing pending orders requiring preparation, status management enabling staff to update 
order states, menu management for adding/editing/removing items and marking items unavailable, 
basic analytics showing daily orders, revenue, and popular items, and user management if needed 
for staff access control.  
Phase 2 Deliverables:  
• Functional Flutter mobile application with all core features implemented  
• M-Pesa payme nt integration working in sandbox environment  
• Loyalty points earning and redemption functional  
• Order tracking with real -time status updates operational  
• React/Next.js administrative dashboard deployed  
• Firestore database running with proper security rules  
• Firebase Authentication active with user registration/login working  
• Version control repository with regular commits documenting progress  
• Chapter 6 technical documentation (implementation details, code explanations, challenges)  
Success Criteria: Application runs on physical Android devices without crashes, complete ordering 
workflow (browse → add to cart → checkout → payment → tracking) functions end -to-end, M -
Pesa payments process successfully in sandbox, loyalty points calculate and apply correc tly, 
administrative dashboard displays orders and enables status updates.  
4.2.3 Phase 3: Testing, Evaluation, and Delivery (Weeks 9 -10) 
Objective: Validate system functionality, performance, and user satisfaction through 
comprehensive testing, gather user feedback, assess objective achievement, and finalize project 
documentation for submission.  
Key Activities:  
The testing phase executes systematic validation across multiple dimensions. Functional testing 
verifies each feature works correctly: all screens lo ad and display appropriate content, buttons and 
interactions respond as expected, data saves and retrieves accurately from Firestore, payment 
processing completes successfully, loyalty points calculate properly, and order status updates 

================================================================================
PAGE 43
================================================================================

reflect in app. Tes t cases are documented with expected vs. actual outcomes, identifying defects 
requiring correction.  
Performance testing measures system responsiveness: app launch time from tap to first screen 
display, menu loading time across varying item counts, order su bmission processing duration, 
payment API response times, and overall application memory and CPU usage. These metrics are 
compared against targets defined in Chapter 3 objectives (e.g., <3 second launch time) with 
optimization if targets aren't met.  
Usabil ity testing recruits actual users (minimum 15 student volunteers per Objective 8) to complete 
realistic scenarios: discover and download the app, create an account, browse menus and selected 
preferred items, place an order with payment, track order status,  and provide feedback via surveys. 
Observations identify user interface confusion points, navigation difficulties, or workflow friction 
not apparent to the developer. Satisfaction ratings quantify overall user experience measuring 
against 75% satisfaction target.  
Security testing verifies proper authentication (unauthorized users cannot access protected 
features), sensitive data protection (passwords hashed, payment information encrypted), and 
Firestore security rules preventing unauthorized data access. Wh ile not penetration testing, basic 
validation ensures no obvious vulnerabilities.  
Bug fixing and refinement address identified issues. Critical bugs blocking core function receive 
immediate priority, medium -severity usability issues are addressed if time p ermits, and minor 
cosmetic issues are documented for potential future improvement but may remain in v1.0 given 
time constraints. The goal is stable, functional system, not perfection.  
Documentation finalization completes all project report chapters: Chapte r 4 (this proposed project 
plan), Chapter 5 (system design diagrams and specifications), Chapter 6 (implementation 
documentation with code explanations), Chapter 7 (testing results and evaluation), and Chapter 8 
(conclusion and reflection). User documentat ion is created including basic app usage guide and 
administrative dashboard manual if stakeholders request.  
Deployment preparation packages the application for distribution: generating signed APK for 
Android installation, creating Play Store listing if pub lishing (optional given academic context), 
deploying Firebase backend to production environment from development, and documenting 
deployment process for reproducibility. Final demo/presentation materials are prepared for project 
presentation.  
Phase 3 Deliv erables:  
• Comprehensive test results documentation (functional, performance, usability, security)  
• User testing feedback from 15+ participants with satisfaction metrics  
• Bug reports with resolution status  

================================================================================

4.6 Conclusion  
 

================================================================================
PAGE 52
================================================================================

This chapter has presented a comprehensive and realistic plan for developing the Cafeteria 
Ordering and Loyalty Reward System, demonstrating that the ambitious objectives outlined in 
Chapter 3 are achievable within the constraints of a 10 -week academic project timeline and 
minimal financial resources. The proposed approach balances technical sophistication with 
pragmatic acknowledgment of solo developer limitations, leveraging modern cloud -based  tools 
and frameworks that enable rapid development without sacrificing quality or functionality.  
 
The three -phase methodology —Research and Design (Weeks 1 -3), Development and 
Implementation (Weeks 4 -8), and Testing and Evaluation (Weeks 9 -10)—provides a s tructured 
progression from concept to deployed system while maintaining the flexibility essential for 
iterative software development. Each phase has clearly defined objectives, deliverables, and 
success criteria, enabling checkpoint evaluations that ensure  quality before proceeding and allow 
course correction if challenges emerge. The sequential nature of phases reflects natural project 
dependencies: design must precede implementation, implementation must precede meaningful 
testing, yet within each phase it erative cycles enable continuous refinement based on emerging 
insights.  
 
The technology stack selection —Flutter for cross -platform mobile development, Firebase for 
backend infrastructure, M -Pesa Daraja API for payments, and React/Next.js for administrative  
interfaces —reflects careful consideration of project requirements balanced against development 
complexity and cost constraints. Flutter's single codebase supporting both iOS and Android 
platforms maximizes potential user reach while minimizing development  effort, critical for a solo 
developer timeline. Firebase's managed services eliminate server administration overhead, 
allowing focus on application logic rather than infrastructure management. The entire technology 
stack operates within free tiers for edu cational use, keeping total project cost under $50, 
demonstrating that financial constraints need not preclude sophisticated technical solutions.  
 
The detailed 10 -week timeline presented in Section 4.4 provides a realistic roadmap with specific 
weekly mile stones and clear dependency chains. Critical path analysis identifies that 
authentication must precede order placement, order placement must precede payment integration, 
and all features must be complete before meaningful user testing —logical dependencies that 
inform scheduling decisions and highlight where delays in one component cascade to subsequent 
work. The allocation of 30% of time to research and design, 50% to development, and 20% to 
testing and documentation reflects industry best practices adapted  to academic project realities, 
ensuring adequate planning before coding begins and sufficient validation before submission.  
 

================================================================================
PAGE 53
================================================================================

Resource requirements demonstrate project feasibility within typical student constraints. Hardware 
needs leverage existing persona l equipment (laptop, smartphone) with no additional purchases 
required. Software requirements utilize entirely free and open -source tools, with all backend 
services operating comfortably within generous free tiers designed for developers and students. 
The solo developer model, while limiting parallel workstreams, eliminates coordination overhead 
and ensures consistent design vision. The total estimated cost of $0 -50 represents an exceptionally 
accessible project scope, proving that impactful software develo pment need not require significant 
capital investment when leveraging modern cloud platforms and open -source ecosystems.  
 
The systematic approach to project planning presented in this chapter establishes confidence that 
the objectives defined in Chapter 3 can be achieved through diligent execution of this roadmap. 
The specificity of week -by-week activities, the clarity of deliverable definitions, the realism of 
resource assessments, and the thoughtfulness of contingency planning collectively demonstrate 
mature project management appropriate for a significant academic undertaking. Potential obstacles 
have been identified and mitigation strategies defined, positioning the project for proactive 
problem -solving rather than reactive crisis management.  
 
Looking ah ead, the subsequent chapters of this report will document the execution of this plan. 
Chapter 5 will present detailed system analysis and design, translating high -level architectural 
concepts into specific UML diagrams, database schemas, and user interface  designs that guide 
implementation. Chapter 6 will chronicle the development process, documenting technical 
decisions, implementation challenges, and solutions discovered during the coding phase. Chapter 
7 will evaluate system performance and user satisfac tion through comprehensive testing, 
validating that objectives were met and the solution effectively addresses the problems identified 
in Chapter 1. Chapter 8 will reflect on the overall project experience, assessing achievements 
against initial goals and identifying opportunities for future enhancement.  
 
The transition from planning to execution begins with Phase 1 activities: finalizing system 
requirements, creating detailed design documents, developing wireframes and database schemas, 
and establishing th e development environment. With the roadmap now clearly defined, the focus 
shifts from planning what to build to the rewarding work of actually building it —transforming the 
conceptual solution into tangible software that will improve the campus dining expe rience for 
students while providing cafeteria management with modern operational tools.  
This proposed project represents more than an academic exercise; it addresses a real problem 
affecting daily campus life with a practical solution leveraging current te chnology trends: mobile -
first design, cloud -based infrastructure, digital payments, and customer engagement through 
loyalty programs. The system's success will validate not only the technical capabilities developed 

================================================================================

during this project but also the broader vision that thoughtful application of technology can 
meaningfully improve institutional services and student experiences.

5 CHAPTER 5: SYSTEM ANALYSIS AND DESIGN  
5.1 Overview  
The system analysis and design phase translates the project requirements and objectives defined 
in previous chapters into a concrete technical blueprint guiding implementation. This chapter 
presents the comprehensive architectural design, data modeling, user interface specifications, and 
technical requirements for the Cafeteria Ordering and Loyalty Reward System. The design 
approach balances academic rigor with practical implementation constraints, creating a system 
architecture that is sophisticated enough to demonstrate advanced software engineering principles 
while remaining achievable within a 10 -week solo development timeline.  
Architecture Overview  
The system employs a modern  three -tier client -server architecture  leveraging cloud -native 
technologies to maximize scalability, minimize infrastructure overhead, and enable rapid 
development. The presentation tier consists of a Flutter -based cross -platform mobile application 
providing the primary user interface for students and a React -based web dashboard for 
administrative functions. The application tier  utilizes Firebase Cloud Functions for serverless 
business logic execution, handling operations requiring server -side processing such as payment 
verification, loyalty point calculations, and complex data aggregations. The data tier combines 
Cloud Firestore  for primary data persistence with M -Pesa Daraja API for payment processing 
integration, creating a distributed data architecture that separates transactional payment data from 
application data while maintaining referential integrity through foreign key re lationships.  
This architectural pattern provides several strategic advantages: the client -server separation 
enables independent scaling of presentation and data layers, the cloud -native approach eliminates 
server procurement and maintenance overhead making  it ideal for academic projects with limited 
budgets, and the use of managed services (Firebase, Cloud Functions) reduces operational 
complexity allowing focus on application logic rather than infrastructure management. The 
mobile -first design acknowledges  contemporary usage patterns where students predominantly 
access services via smartphones, while the administrative web interface recognizes that cafeteria 
staff benefit from larger screen workflows for order queue management and menu administration.  
Desig n Philosophy  
The design philosophy centers on five core 
principles:  simplicity , performance , scalability , security , and  user-centricity . Simplicity 
manifests in the decision to use managed cloud services rather than custom server infrastructure, 
reducing s ystem complexity and potential failure points. The Flutter framework selection 
exemplifies this principle —a single codebase compiles to both iOS and Android platforms, 
eliminating the complexity of maintaining separate native applications while still deliv ering native 
performance and platform -specific UI conventions.  
Performance receives explicit design attention through strategic caching, optimized database 
queries, and asynchronous operations. The system implements client -side menu caching to reduce 

================================================================================
PAGE 56
================================================================================

netwo rk requests and improve perceived responsiveness, structures Firestore queries with 
appropriate indexing to ensure sub -second response times even with thousands of menu items or 
orders, and employs asynchronous programming patterns ensuring UI responsivene ss during 
network operations. These performance optimizations directly address the usability objective 
requiring menu loading times under 2 seconds and checkout processes completing within 10 
seconds.  
Scalability considerations inform architectural decisio ns despite the initial deployment scope being 
limited to a single campus cafeteria. The Firestore database selection provides horizontal scaling 
capabilities supporting growth from hundreds to millions of users without architectural redesign, 
Cloud Functio ns automatically scale based on demand ensuring consistent performance during 
peak lunch hours when order volume spikes, and the stateless application design enables load 
distribution across multiple instances if needed. This scalability orientation ensure s the system 
remains viable if successful initial deployment leads to expansion across multiple cafeterias or 
universities.  
Security is integrated throughout the design rather than treated as an afterthought. Firebase 
Authentication provides industry -stand ard user identity management with secure password 
hashing, email verification, and session token management. All data transmission occurs over 
HTTPS/TLS encrypted connections preventing man -in-the-middle attacks. Firestore security rules 
implement role -based access control ensuring users can only access their own order history and 
personal data while preventing unauthorized menu modifications. Payment processing leverages 
M-Pesa's secure payment infrastructure rather than handling sensitive financial data d irectly, 
delegating PCI DSS compliance responsibility to Safaricom's established systems.  
User-centricity drives interface design decisions, workflow optimization, and feature 
prioritization. The system recognizes three distinct user personas with differen t needs: students 
seeking quick, convenient ordering with minimal friction; cafeteria staff requiring efficient order 
queue management and inventory control; and administrators needing analytics and system 
configuration capabilities. Each persona receives tailored interfaces optimized for their specific 
workflows —students get a streamlined mobile experience emphasizing speed and simplicity, staff 
receive real -time order queues with one -tap status updates, and administrators access 
comprehensive dashboards w ith analytics visualization. This multi -persona approach ensures the 
system serves all stakeholders effectively rather than optimizing for a single user type at others' 
expense.  
The design process itself followed an iterative methodology beginning with hig h-level 
architectural decisions, progressing through detailed component design, and culminating in 
specific implementation specifications. Early design iterations explored alternative architectures 
including traditional LAMP stack server deployment and nat ive mobile development, but these 
were rejected due to higher complexity, slower development velocity, and greater infrastructure 
costs. The selected cloud -native, mobile -first architecture emerged as the optimal balance of 
capability, cost, development ef ficiency, and alignment with contemporary best practices for 
mobile application development.

5.2 System Architecture  
The Cafeteria Ordering and Loyalty Reward System implements a  three -tier 
architecture  separating concerns across presentation, application , and data layers. This 
architectural pattern, well -established in enterprise software engineering, provides modularity 
enabling independent development, testing, and scaling of each layer while maintaining clear 
interfaces between components. The architec ture leverages cloud -native services throughout, 
eliminating traditional server infrastructure in favor of managed platforms that provide superior 
reliability, automatic scaling, and reduced operational overhead.  
Three -Tier Architecture  
 
Figure5.1 -System  Architecture Diagram  
 
Presentation Layer  
The presentation layer consists of two primary client applications serving distinct user personas: 
the Flutter mobile application for students and the React web dashboard for cafeteria 
administrators and  staff.  
Flutter Mobile Application  
The Flutter mobile application represents the primary user interface for students, providing 
comprehensive functionality for menu browsing, order placement, payment processing, order 
tracking, and loyalty program engageme nt. Built using Google's Flutter framework, the application 
compiles to native ARM code for both iOS and Android platforms from a single Dart codebase, 


================================================================================
PAGE 58
================================================================================

maximizing development efficiency while delivering native performance and platform -specific UI 
conventio ns. 
The application architecture follows the  BLoC (Business Logic Component) pattern , separating 
UI presentation from business logic and state management. This separation enables comprehensive 
unit testing of business logic independent of UI, facilitates c ode reuse across multiple screens 
sharing common functionality, and provides reactive UI updates through stream -based state 
propagation. The BLoC pattern integrates seamlessly with Flutter's reactive framework where UI 
widgets rebuild automatically in resp onse to state changes.  
Key architectural components within the mobile app include:  
• Authentication Module : Manages user registration, login, password reset, and session 
persistence using Firebase Authentication SDK  
• Menu Browser : Displays categorized menu items with search, filtering, and detailed 
product views  
• Shopping Cart : Manages order composition with add/remove operations, quantity 
adjustments, and real -time price calculations  
• Checkout Engine : Orchestrates the multi -step checkout proc ess including delivery 
preferences, order review, and payment initiation  
• Payment Integration : Interfaces with M -Pesa Daraja API for STK Push payment requests 
and handles payment callback verification  
• Order Tracking : Provides real -time order status monitori ng using Firestore snapshot 
listeners for live updates  
• Loyalty Manager : Displays points balance, transaction history, and redemption interface  
• Profile Manager : Handles user profile viewing, editing, password changes, and account 
settings  
The application im plements  offline -first architecture  for menu browsing, caching menu data 
locally using shared preferences and SQLite persistence. This ensures users can browse menus and 
prepare carts even without network connectivity, with synchronization occurring when 
connectivity resumes. Critical operations requiring server interaction (payment, order submission) 
gracefully handle connectivity failures with retry logic and clear user feedback.  
React Administrative Dashboard  
The administrative web dashboard provides caf eteria staff and system administrators with order 
management, menu administration, and analytics capabilities. Built using React with Next.js 
framework, the dashboard delivers a responsive web interface accessible from any device with a 
modern browser, eli minating the need for native application installation on staff devices.  
The dashboard architecture employs  React Context API for state management , maintaining 
global application state for authenticated user session, active order queue, and menu inventory. 
Server -side rendering through Next.js provides superior initial page load performance and SEO 

================================================================================
PAGE 59
================================================================================

benefits compared to traditional single -page applications, though the latter is less relevant for an 
authenticated internal tool.  
Administrative dashboard compone nts include:  
• Order Queue Display : Real -time list of pending orders sorted by priority and timestamp  
• Order Status Management : Interface for updating order preparation status with one -click 
state transitions  
• Menu Administration : CRUD (Create, Read, Update, D elete) operations for menu items 
including image uploads  
• Inventory Management : Mark items as available/unavailable, adjust prices, modify 
descriptions  
• Analytics Dashboard : Visualizations showing daily orders, revenue trends, popular items, 
and peak hours  
• User Management : View registered users, monitor loyalty points, handle support requests  
Application Layer  
The application layer implements server -side business logic through  Firebase Cloud Functions , 
serverless functions executing in Google's managed infrastructure. Cloud Functions respond to 
HTTP requests from client applications and database triggers from Firestore, enabling complex 
operations requiring server -side execution for security, performance, or integration with external 
services.  
Key Cloud Functions include:  
• Payment Verification Function : Validates M -Pesa payment callbacks, confirms 
transaction authenticity, and updates order payment status  
• Loyalty Points Calculator : Triggered when orders complete, calculates earned points 
based on purchase amount, applies multipliers for promotions, and updates user loyalty 
balance  
• Order Notification Function : Sends push notifications to users when order status changes 
(confirmed, preparing, ready for pickup)  
• Analytics Aggregator : Periodically calculates dai ly/weekly sales totals, popular items 
rankings, and revenue metrics for dashboard display  
• Menu Validation Function : Validates menu item data during creation/editing ensuring 
price ranges, categories, and required fields meet business rules  
The serverless a rchitecture provides automatic scaling —during peak lunch hours when dozens of 
orders submit simultaneously, Google's infrastructure automatically provisions additional function 
instances to handle load. During off -peak hours, functions scale to zero elimin ating idle capacity 
costs. This elastic scaling ensures consistent performance without manual capacity planning.  

================================================================================
PAGE 60
================================================================================

Data Layer  
The data layer combines  Cloud Firestore  for primary data persistence with  Firebase 
Authentication  for identity management and the  M-Pesa Daraja API  for payment processing, 
creating a distributed data architecture where different data types reside in systems optimized for 
their specific characteristics.  
Cloud Firestore Database  
Firestore provides the primary data store for all applicati on data including users, menu items, 
orders, and loyalty transactions. As a NoSQL document database, Firestore organizes data into 
collections containing documents (JSON -like objects) that can hold nested subcollections, 
enabling flexible schema design acc ommodating evolving requirements.  
Firestore's real -time synchronization capabilities enable live updates —when a cafeteria staff 
member updates an order status, the user's mobile app receives the change instantly through 
snapshot listeners without polling. This real -time functionality is critical for order tracking features 
where users expect immediate status visibility.  
Security rules implemented directly in Firestore enforce access control at the database level: users 
can read only their own order history,  staff can update order statuses but not modify historical data, 
and administrators have comprehensive access. These rules execute server -side, preventing client -
side bypass attempts.  
Firebase Authentication  
Firebase Authentication manages user identities,  password storage, session tokens, and email 
verification. The system uses email/password authentication as the primary method, with future 
potential for social login integration (Google Sign -In, Facebook Login). Firebase handles security 
best practices in cluding bcrypt password hashing, secure token generation, and session expiration 
management.  
M-Pesa Daraja API Integration  
M-Pesa integration occurs through Safaricom's Daraja API, specifically the  STK Push (Lipa na 
M-Pesa Online)  functionality. When users  initiate payment, Cloud Functions call the Daraja API 
with transaction details, prompting users to authorize payment on their phones. Daraja sends 
payment confirmation callbacks to configured webhook endpoints, which Cloud Functions verify 
and process to update order payment status.  
This integration pattern delegates payment security and PCI compliance to Safaricom's 
infrastructure while providing seamless integration with Kenya's dominant mobile money 
platform. The system never handles sensitive payment c redentials or card numbers, reducing 
security risk and compliance burden.  

================================================================================
PAGE 61
================================================================================

Communication Protocols  
All communication between layers utilizes industry -standard protocols ensuring security and 
interoperability:  
• HTTPS/TLS : All client -server communication encrypted end -to-end preventing 
eavesdropping  
• REST API : Cloud Functions expose RESTful HTTP endpoints for stateless request -
response patterns  
• WebSocket (Firestore Listeners) : Real -time database synchronization uses WebSocket 
connections for bidirectional communication  
• OAuth 2.0 : M-Pesa Daraja API authentication follows OAuth 2.0 protocol with bearer 
tokens  
• JSON : All data serialization uses JSON format for universal compatibility and human 
readability  
5.3 Use Case Diagrams  
Use case diagrams provide a high -level visualization of system functionality from users' 
perspectives, identifying actors (entities interacting with the system) and use cases (discrete 
functional requirements). The Cafeteria Ordering and Loyalty Reward System serves multiple 
distinct actor types, each with specific interaction patterns and functional needs.  
Actors Identification  
The system recognizes four primary actor categories:  
1. Student (Customer) : The primary end -user who browses menus, places orders, makes 
payments, tracks deliveries, and participates in the loyalty program  
2. Cafeteria Staff : Employees who manage daily operations including order queue 
monitoring, status updates, and basic inventory management  
3. System Administrator : Personnel with comprehensive system access for menu 
management, user administration, analytics viewing, and system configuration  
4. Payment Gateway (M -Pesa) : External system actor representing the M -Pesa payment 
infrastructure that processes financial transactions  
Additionally, two secondary actors interact indirectly:  
5. Firebase Authentication Service : External system providing identity verification and 
session management  
6. Firebase Cloud Messaging : External service delivering push notifications to mobile 
devices

================================================================================

emails, s ends verification email, and creates user record in Firestore with initial loyalty points 
balance of zero.  
UC2: Browse Menu and Place Order  - Students view categorized menu items with images, 
descriptions, prices, and preparation times. They can search by name, filter by category (breakfast, 
lunch, snacks, beverages), and view detailed nutritional information if available. Selected items 
add to cart with quantity specification. Cart displays running total including any applied discounts 
from loyalty point r edemption.  
UC3: Checkout and Payment  - Students review cart contents, specify pickup time preferences, 
enter special instructions (dietary restrictions, extra sauce requests), and select payment method. 
The system initiates M -Pesa STK Push sending payment prompt to student's phone. Upon payment 
authorization, the system creates order record, deducts loyalty points if applied, and displays 
confirmation with order tracking number.  
UC4: Track Order Status  - Students monitor order preparation progress through r eal-time status 
indicators: Order Received → Payment Confirmed → Preparing → Ready for Pickup → 
Completed. Push notifications alert students when status changes, particularly when orders are 
ready. The tracking interface shows estimated pickup time and cur rent queue position if applicable.  
UC5: Manage Loyalty Points  - Students view current points balance, earn points automatically 
on order completion (calculated as 1 point per 100 KES spent), review points transaction history 
with dates and source orders, r edeem accumulated points for discounts (100 points = 50 KES 
discount), and see points expiration dates if expiration policy is implemented.

UC6: Manage  Order Queue  - Staff view all pending orders in chronological order or sorted by 
priority (scheduled pickup time, VIP customers). Each order displays customer name, items 


================================================================================
PAGE 65
================================================================================

ordered, quantities, special instructions, payment status, and elapsed time since pla cement. Staff 
can expand orders to see full details including student contact information for clarification 
questions.  
UC7: Update Order Status  - Staff transition orders through preparation workflow with one -tap 
status updates. Changing status to "Preparin g" removes order from pending queue and adds to 
active preparation list. Marking "Ready" triggers push notification to student and moves order to 
pickup area queue. Completing order archives it to history and triggers loyalty points calculation.  
UC8: Manag e Inventory Availability  - Staff mark menu items as unavailable when ingredients 
run out, preventing new orders for those items. Items marked unavailable display greyed out in 
student app with "Currently Unavailable" messaging. Staff can re -enable items wh en inventory 
replenishes.  

================================================================================

================================================================================

 
Figure 5.4 - System Administrator Use Case Diagram  
 
Primary Administrator Use Cases  
UC9: Manage Menu Items  - Administrators have full CRUD operations on menu catalog. 
Creating items requires name, description, base price, category assignment, and image upload. 


================================================================================
PAGE 67
================================================================================

Editing allows price adjustments, description updates, category changes, and image replacements. 
Dele ting items performs soft delete (marks inactive) rather than hard delete to preserve historical 
order data referencing those items.  
UC10: Configure Loyalty Program  - Administrators adjust loyalty program parameters 
including points earning rate (default 1 point per 100 KES), redemption value (default 100 points 
= 50 KES), points expiration period if desired, bonus point multiplier events (double points day), 
and minimum purchase amount for points eligibility.  
UC11: View Analytics  - Administrators access com prehensive dashboards showing key 
performance indicators: total daily/weekly/monthly revenue, number of orders by time period, 
average order value, most popular menu items ranked by quantity sold, peak order hours for 
staffing optimization, loyalty program  participation rate, and customer retention metrics.

Figure 5.5 - External Systems Integration Use Case Diagram  
External Integration Use Cases  
UC12: Process M -Pesa Payment  - When student confirms order, system generates payment 
request with transaction r eference, amount, and customer phone number. Cloud Functions call M -
Pesa Daraja API OAuth endpoint to obtain access token, then submit STK Push request. M -Pesa 
sends USSD payment prompt to student's phone. Student enters M -Pesa PIN authorizing payment. 


================================================================================
PAGE 69
================================================================================

M-Pesa processes transaction and sends callback to system webhook with result code, transaction 
ID, and confirmation details.  
UC13: Real -time Notifications  - When staff update order status, Cloud Function triggers Firebase 
Cloud Messaging to send push notific ation to student's registered device. Notification includes 
order number, new status, and estimated pickup time. Student app receives notification even when 
backgrounded or closed, displaying system notification with sound/vibration based on device 
setting s. 
5.4 Activity Diagrams  
Activity diagrams model the dynamic behavior of the system by illustrating workflows, business 
processes, and algorithmic logic including sequential activities, decision points, parallel processes, 
and control flow. These diagrams provide detailed insight into how specific use cases execute from 
start to completion, highlighting the procedural steps and conditional logic governing system 
operations.  
User Registration and Login Workflow

================================================================================
PAGE 71
================================================================================

Figure 5.6 - User Registration Activity Diagram  
 
The registration workflow implements comprehensive validation ensuring data quality and 
preventing duplicate accounts. Email format validation uses regex pattern matching, phone number 
validation confirms Kenyan format (+254 or 07xx), and  password strength requirements enforce 
minimum 8 characters with at least one number. The email uniqueness check prevents users from 
creating multiple accounts with the same email, which could complicate order tracking and loyalty 
points management.  

================================================================================
PAGE 72
================================================================================

 
Figure 5.7 - User Login Activity Diagram  
 


================================================================================
PAGE 73
================================================================================

The login workflow includes security features like failed attempt limiting to prevent brute force 
attacks and email verification checking to ensure account authenticity. Session token generation 
uses Firebase Authenti cation's built -in JWT (JSON Web Token) mechanism, providing secure, 
stateless authentication suitable for mobile applications.  
Order Placement Workflow

================================================================================

Figure 5.8 - Complete Order Placement Activity Diagram  
 
This workflow demonstrates the shopping cart pattern common in e -commerce applications, 
adapted for food ordering context. The loyalty points decision point allows optional discount 
application without forcing users to redeem points on every order. The order creation before 
payment comp letion enables payment abandonment tracking —orders created but never paid 
indicate potential friction in the payment process.  
M-Pesa Payment Processing Workflow

================================================================================
PAGE 77
================================================================================

Figure 5.9 - M-Pesa Payment Processing Activity Diagram  
 
The payment workflow involves comple x interaction between multiple systems requiring careful 
orchestration. The STK Push mechanism provides better user experience than manual M -Pesa 
transfers by automatically prompting payment without users needing to remember paybill numbers 
or account numb ers. Callback validation prevents fraudulent payment confirmation attempts —
Cloud Functions verify callback requests originate from M -Pesa's IP addresses and contain valid 
signatures before updating order status.  
Order Status Update Workflow

================================================================================

Figure 5.10 - Order Status Update Activity Diagram  
 
This workflow models the order lifecycle from creation through completion, showing state 
transitions and notification triggers. The 5 -minute payment timeout prevents unpaid orders from 
cluttering the queue. The parall el preparation activities recognize that kitchen staff can prepare 
multiple components simultaneously (cooking rice while grilling chicken), improving overall 
throughput.  
Loyalty Points Calculation and Redemption Workflow

================================================================================

Figure 5.11 - Loyalty Points Cal culation Activity Diagram  
 
 
Figure 5.12 - Loyalty Points Redemption Activity Diagram  
 
The loyalty program workflows implement a simple but effective points system: earn 1 point per 
100 KES spent, redeem 100 points for 50 KES discount (50% value to encoura ge continued 
spending rather than immediate full -value redemption). The points reservation mechanism during 


================================================================================
PAGE 82
================================================================================

checkout prevents race conditions where users might redeem the same points on multiple 
simultaneous orders.  
5.5 Sequence Diagrams  
Sequence diagrams illustrate object interactions arranged in time sequence, showing the order of 
messages exchanged between components to accomplish specific functionality. These diagrams 
emphasize the temporal ordering of operations and clearly delineate responsib ilities across system 
components, making them particularly valuable for understanding complex multi -component 
interactions like payment processing and real -time synchronization.  
User Authentication Sequence  
 
Figure 5.13 - User Login Sequence Diagram  
 
The login sequence demonstrates the coordinated interaction between UI, business logic, 
authentication service, and database. The authentication controller acts as a mediator, preventing 
direct coupling between UI and Firebase services. The JWT token returned by Firebase 
Authentication persists in secure local storage, enabling automatic re -authentication on subsequent 
app launches without requiring password re -entry.  
Order Placement and Payment Sequence  


================================================================================
PAGE 83
================================================================================

 
Figure 5.14 - Order Placement Sequence Diagram  
 
This sequence illustrates the most complex workflow in the system, involving five distinct 
components. The asynchronous nature of M -Pesa payment requires careful state management —
the app cannot block waiting for payment completion since users might take se veral minutes to 
authorize. The Firestore snapshot listener pattern enables reactive UI updates: when Cloud 
Functions update the order's payment status, the listener fires automatically updating the app's UI 
without polling.  
Real -Time Order Tracking Sequen ce 
 


================================================================================
PAGE 84
================================================================================

 
Figure 5.15 - Real -Time Order Tracking Sequence Diagram  
 
The real -time tracking sequence showcases Firestore's live synchronization capabilities. The 
snapshot listener maintains an open WebSocket connection receiving instant updates when the 
order do cument changes. This eliminates the need for inefficient polling (repeatedly querying "has 
my order status changed?") reducing server load and battery consumption while providing superior 
user experience with instant updates.  
Menu Loading and Caching Seque nce 


================================================================================
PAGE 85
================================================================================

 
Figure 5.16 - Menu Loading with Cache Sequence Diagram  
 
This sequence demonstrates the offline -first pattern improving perceived performance and 
reliability. Users see menu content instantly from cache rather than waiting for network reques ts. 
The parallel network fetch updates the cache in background without blocking UI rendering. This 


================================================================================
PAGE 86
================================================================================

pattern ensures the app remains functional even without connectivity —users can browse menus 
and prepare carts offline, with synchronization occurring when co nnectivity resumes.  
Loyalty Points Calculation Sequence  
 
Figure 5.17 - Loyalty Points Calculation Sequence Diagram  
 
This sequence illustrates server -side business logic execution via Cloud Functions. The Firestore 
trigger automatically invokes the function when an order status changes to "Completed", ensuring 
points calculation occurs reliably without requiring client -side code execution. Server -side 
calculation prevents client manipulation —users cannot modify code to award themselves arbitrary 
points. 
5.6 Class Diagrams  
Class diagrams represent the static structure of the system by modeling classes (object templates), 
their attributes (data), methods (behavior), and relationships (associations, dependencies, 
inheritance). While the system uses Fires tore's document -based NoSQL database rather than 
traditional object -relational mapping, class diagrams remain valuable for modeling the 
application's domain objects, data transfer objects, and business logic components.

PAGE 89
================================================================================

 
Figure 5.20 - Application Logic Classes Diagram]  
 
Key Relationships and Patterns  
The class structure implements several design patterns:  
Repository P attern : FirestoreService acts as a repository abstracting data access, allowing 
controller code to work with domain objects without coupling to Firestore -specific APIs. This 
enables easier testing (mock repository) and potential future database migration.  
Singleton Pattern : Services (PaymentService, FirestoreService) implement singleton pattern 
ensuring single instances throughout app lifecycle, preventing redundant connections and 
maintaining consistent state.  
Observer Pattern : BLoC controllers expose Stre ams that UI widgets observe for state changes, 
implementing reactive programming where UI automatically updates when underlying data 
changes.  
Composition over Inheritance : OrderItem exists only within Order (composition relationship), 
never independently. When Order deletes, associated OrderItems delete automatically. This 
models real -world relationship —order items don't exist without parent order.

5.8 UI Design  
User interface design represents a critical determinant of application success —even perfectly 
functional systems fail if users find interfaces confusing, unat tractive, or frustrating. This section 
presents the UI/UX design for the Cafeteria Ordering and Loyalty Reward System, including 
wireframes establishing structural layout, high -fidelity mockups demonstrating visual design, and 
design rationale explaining c hoices. The design follows platform -specific guidelines (Material 
Design for Android, iOS Human Interface Guidelines) while maintaining brand consistency across 
platforms.  
Design Philosophy and Principles  
The UI design centers on five core principles:  
1. Simp licity : Minimize cognitive load by presenting only essential information at each step, 
using progressive disclosure to reveal complexity only when needed  
2. Speed : Optimize for task completion velocity —students should browse menus and place 
orders in under 90  seconds  
3. Clarity : Use clear visual hierarchy, readable typography, and unambiguous iconography 
eliminating guesswork  
4. Consistency : Maintain uniform interaction patterns, visual language, and terminology 
throughout the app  
5. Delight : Include subtle animations,  smooth transitions, and encouraging feedback creating 
emotionally positive experiences  
UI Wireframes  
Wireframes provide low -fidelity structural blueprints showing layout, navigation, and content 
hierarchy without visual design details.

Design Rationale  
Food Photography Emphasis : High -quality images drive appetite and purchase decisi ons. Full -
bleed photos on detail screens maximize visual impact.  
One-Tap Actions : "Add to Cart" buttons directly on home screen enable impulse purchases 
without navigation friction.  
Progress Visibility : Real -time order tracking with visual progress indicat ors reduces anxiety and 
support requests.  
Minimal Form Fields : Registration requires only essential inf ormation (name, email, phone, 
password) reducing abandonment.  
Sticky CTAs : Primary action buttons ("Add to Cart", "Proceed to Checkout") remain visible while 
scrolling, preventing users from forgetting to complete actions.  
5.9 Requirements Specification  
The requirements specification formalizes all functional and non -functional requirements guiding 
system development and providing measurable criteria for acceptance testing. Requirements are 
categorized, assigned unique identifiers for traceability, and prio ritized using the MoSCoW 
method (Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have). This structured approach ensures 
comprehensive coverage of system capabilities while maintaining clear scope boundaries 
preventing feature creep.

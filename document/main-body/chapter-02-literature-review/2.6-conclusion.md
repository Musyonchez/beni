# 2.6 Conclusion

This literature review has systematically examined mobile food ordering and campus dining systems across global, regional, and local perspectives to establish the theoretical and practical foundation for the proposed Cafeteria Ordering and Loyalty Reward System. The analysis reveals both the maturity of digital dining solutions in developed markets and the significant opportunities for contextually appropriate implementations in emerging markets, particularly within Kenyan university environments.

The global perspective demonstrated that mobile campus dining technology is well-established and proven. Systems like Grubhub Campus and CBORD GET Mobile serve hundreds of universities, processing millions of orders annually with sophisticated features including menu customization, nutritional tracking, meal plan integration, scheduled pickup, and comprehensive analytics. These platforms validate that students enthusiastically adopt mobile ordering when it provides genuine convenience advantages—eliminating wait times, enabling schedule flexibility, offering transparency, and delivering polished user experiences. The technical architectures (cloud-based backends, native mobile applications, API integrations with institutional systems, real-time order processing) provide blueprints for robust, scalable implementations.

However, the global systems also reveal significant limitations when considering deployment in different contexts. High costs ($30,000-$100,000+ annually for licensing and implementation) make them economically prohibitive for most Kenyan universities. Technology assumptions (ubiquitous internet connectivity, credit card payment dominance, street address systems) don't align with African realities. The vendor dependency inherent in third-party platform adoption creates sustainability risks for institutions. These limitations necessitate alternative approaches rather than direct adoption of existing global solutions.

The regional perspective highlighted how successful platforms adapt to African market realities. Jumia Food's deep M-Pesa integration, handling of intermittent connectivity through aggressive data caching, landmark-based addressing systems, and mixed payment options (mobile money, cash, cards) demonstrate sophisticated localization going far beyond simple translation. Glovo's WhatsApp integration for customer support, use of gig economy delivery adapted to local labor markets, and subscription pricing models represent further adaptations. These African platforms prove that African consumers embrace mobile ordering when solutions genuinely accommodate rather than ignore contextual factors.

Yet the regional systems focus on consumer restaurant delivery rather than institutional cafeteria environments, leaving a functionality gap. Features essential to campus dining—meal plan integration, student identification, batch ordering for events, nutritional tracking aligned with educational health initiatives, institutional analytics for operational planning—are absent from consumer delivery platforms. The business models (commission-based revenue from restaurants, per-delivery fees) don't translate directly to campus contexts where cafeterias operate as services rather than profit-maximizing businesses.

The local perspective grounded the review in the specific realities of Kenyan university cafeterias. The examination of traditional manual operations documented substantial pain points: 20-40 minute wait times during peak hours, cash-heavy payment systems creating inefficiencies and risks, absence of nutritional information, lack of customer data preventing informed management decisions, and overall student dissatisfaction reflected in meal skipping and complaints. The Strathmore University case study demonstrated that Kenyan students readily adopt digital dining services (cashless ID card payments) when implemented, validating market readiness while simultaneously highlighting that payment alone doesn't transform the complete dining experience—mobile ordering, loyalty, engagement, and analytics remain unaddressed even in the most digitally progressive Kenyan institutions.

The comparative analysis synthesized these findings into a clear gap identification. Successful campus dining technology exists but is too costly and contextually mismatched for most Kenyan universities. African food delivery platforms handle local payment and connectivity realities but lack campus-specific functionality. Traditional cafeteria operations are affordable but deliver poor student experiences and limited operational intelligence. Strathmore's payment digitalization shows promise but represents only partial transformation.

The opportunity—and the justification for this project—lies in developing a solution that combines the best elements of these various approaches: the mobile ordering and analytics capabilities of global campus platforms, the M-Pesa integration and connectivity resilience of African food delivery platforms, the institutional integration demonstrated by Strathmore, and an cost structure accessible to resource-constrained institutions. By adding integrated loyalty rewards as a differentiator addressing the identified gap in customer engagement, the proposed Cafeteria Ordering and Loyalty Reward System aims to deliver comprehensive digital transformation appropriate to the Kenyan university context.

The subsequent chapters build upon this foundation. Chapter 3 defines specific, measurable objectives aligned with addressing the problems documented in Chapter 1 and achieving capabilities exemplified by the systems reviewed in this chapter. Chapter 4 outlines the project methodology and implementation approach informed by best practices identified across the reviewed systems. Chapters 5-7 document the system design, implementation, and evaluation, incorporating lessons learned from both successes and failures of the platforms examined in this literature review.

# 2.1 Introduction

The purpose of this literature review is to examine existing mobile food ordering and loyalty reward systems across different geographical and institutional contexts to understand their approaches, identify best practices, and recognize gaps that the proposed Cafeteria Ordering and Loyalty Reward System aims to address. This review provides the theoretical and practical foundation for the project by analyzing how similar problems have been solved in commercial, institutional, and campus settings globally, regionally within Africa, and locally within Kenya.

The scope of this literature review encompasses three distinct perspectives: global, regional, and local. The global perspective examines successful mobile food ordering platforms and campus dining solutions from developed markets, particularly in North America, Europe, and Asia, where digital transformation of food service has been most advanced. The regional perspective focuses on food ordering and payment systems developed specifically for African markets, considering unique contextual factors such as mobile payment ecosystem maturity, infrastructure challenges, and cultural preferences. The local perspective examines Kenyan university and institutional food service systems, providing direct insights into the specific operating environment for the proposed system.

This review is organized systematically to facilitate comparative analysis. Section 2.2 presents the global perspective, analyzing two to three internationally recognized food ordering platforms or university campus dining systems, examining their features, user experience, technology architecture, and business models. Section 2.3 shifts to the regional perspective, reviewing two food service technology implementations from African countries, with attention to how they address continent-specific challenges and opportunities. Section 2.4 provides the local perspective through examination of two Kenyan university or institutional cafeteria systems, whether digital or traditional, to understand current practices and user expectations within the target deployment context.

The methodology employed in this literature review combines academic sources, industry reports, system documentation, and hands-on evaluation of publicly accessible platforms. Academic databases including Google Scholar and IEEE Xplore were searched using keywords such as "mobile food ordering," "university cafeteria systems," "loyalty rewards programs," "campus dining technology," and "mobile payment integration." Industry sources including technology blogs, company case studies, and app store reviews provided insights into user experiences and system capabilities. Where possible, the reviewed systems were directly tested through mobile applications or web interfaces to gain first-hand understanding of their functionality, user interface design, and operational workflows.

Each system reviewed in this chapter is analyzed along several dimensions: the problem it addresses, key features offered, technology stack employed, user interface and experience design, payment integration approach, loyalty or engagement mechanisms, strengths that make it successful, and limitations or weaknesses that represent opportunities for improvement. This consistent analytical framework enables meaningful comparison across diverse systems and contexts, ultimately informing the design decisions for the proposed Cafeteria Ordering and Loyalty Reward System.

The synthesis of findings from these three perspectives—global best practices, regional adaptations, and local context—culminates in Section 2.5, which presents a comparative analysis highlighting common strengths, prevalent weaknesses, and identified gaps that the proposed system will address. Section 2.6 concludes the literature review by articulating how the insights gained justify and inform the specific approach taken in this project, positioning it as both grounded in proven practices and innovative in addressing unmet needs within the university cafeteria context.

# 2.4 Local Perspective

## 2.4.1 Current University Cafeteria Operations in Kenya (Traditional Model)

**Overview**

To understand the local context for campus dining technology implementation, it is essential to examine the current state of cafeteria operations at Kenyan universities. Most institutions, including the University of Nairobi (UoN), Kenyatta University, Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology (JKUAT), and numerous private universities, continue to operate cafeterias using predominantly traditional, manual ordering and service models. While a few institutions have begun exploring digital solutions, the vast majority rely on face-to-face ordering, cash payments, and manual record-keeping—the baseline against which any proposed digital transformation must be measured.

A typical Kenyan university cafeteria operates during defined meal periods (breakfast 7:00-9:00 AM, lunch 12:00-3:00 PM, dinner 6:00-8:00 PM) with peak congestion occurring immediately after morning and afternoon classes end. Cafeterias at major universities serve hundreds to thousands of students daily, with serving capacity often lagging behind enrollment growth. Physical infrastructure varies—some institutions have modern, well-equipped cafeterias while others operate in aging facilities with limited seating, inadequate ventilation, and insufficient service points.

**Operational Model and Student Experience**

The standard ordering process requires students to physically queue at service counters manned by cafeteria staff. Menus are typically displayed on wall-mounted boards with items and prices listed in chalk or whiteboard markers, though items may be crossed out when unavailable without advance notice to students in line. Menu options usually include staple foods (ugali, rice, chapati), protein options (beef, chicken, beans), vegetable sides (sukuma wiki, cabbage), and beverages (tea, sodas, juice). Pricing is relatively affordable compared to off-campus restaurants, reflecting institutional subsidies and the captive market, with typical meals ranging from  Ksh 80-200 ($0.60-$1.50 USD equivalent).

Students communicate orders verbally to serving staff, who manually portion food from large cooking pots or steam trays. Portion control is

 inconsistent, varying based on time of day (earlier customers often receive larger portions before food runs low), specific server, and sometimes interpersonal relationships between staff and regular customers. No standardized nutritional information is provided, and students with specific dietary needs or allergies must verbally inquire about ingredients, relying on serving staff's knowledge which may be incomplete.

Payment occurs at a separate cashier station after food is received, creating a two-queue system (ordering queue, then payment queue). Cash is the predominant payment method, with most cafeterias accepting Kenyan Shillings only. Some institutional cafeterias accept student ID cards preloaded with funds (similar to declining balance accounts), though adoption varies widely and reloading these accounts often requires visiting specific offices during limited hours, creating its own friction. Mobile money (M-Pesa) acceptance is inconsistent—some cafeterias accept it informally while others explicitly require cash due to concerns about transaction costs or accounting complexity.

Wait times during peak hours regularly extend to 20-40 minutes encompassing queuing, ordering, payment, and finding seating. This time investment becomes particularly problematic for students with back-to-back classes or those traveling from distant parts of large campuses. Many students report skipping meals entirely when queues appear excessive, opting instead for quick snacks from campus kiosks or going hungry until returning home after classes. The physical crowding and noise during peak periods create stressful dining experiences inconsistent with ideal campus environments.

**Operational Challenges for Cafeteria Management**

From the cafeteria operators' perspective, the traditional model presents significant management challenges. Inventory forecasting relies on historical patterns and staff intuition rather than data-driven demand prediction. This results in frequent stockouts of popular items, forcing last-minute substitutions that disappoint customers, or over-preparation leading to food waste and financial losses. Without order pre-placement, demand appears suddenly when classes end, creating chaotic kitchen conditions and rushed food preparation that may compromise quality.

Financial management is complex and error-prone. Cash handling requires careful counting, secure storage, daily reconciliation, and transportation to banks—all introducing opportunities for theft or accounting errors. Revenue attribution to specific menu items is estimated rather than precisely known, making it difficult to identify profitable versus unprofitable offerings or optimize menu design for financial performance. Labor scheduling is inefficient, with staffing levels often mismatched to actual demand patterns because those patterns aren't quantified with precision.

Customer feedback mechanisms are nearly non-existent in most traditional operations. Complaint boxes may be placed in cafeterias but are rarely monitored proactively, and anonymous complaints are difficult to investigate or address. There's no systematic way to identify trends in customer satisfaction, popular versus disliked items, or service quality issues that might be correctable if promptly identified. Management operates with limited visibility into the actual student experience beyond occasional informal observations.

**Emerging Digital Initiatives**

A small number of Kenyan universities have begun exploring digital solutions, though implementations remain limited and often partial. Some initiatives include:

WhatsApp ordering groups where students send orders via text to cafeteria staff who prepare meals for scheduled pickup, eliminating queuing but introducing manual coordination overhead and scaling challenges. This model works for small user groups but breaks down at scale.

Mobile money (M-Pesa) payment acceptance, either formally integrated through till numbers or informally through staff personal numbers. This addresses payment convenience but doesn't solve ordering efficiency, menu visibility, or data collection challenges.

Student portal integrations where meal account balances can be checked online and possibly topped up, though the actual ordering and service delivery remains manual. These represent incremental improvements in financial transparency without transforming the core dining experience.

These emerged initiatives demonstrate student and institutional recognition that digital transformation could improve campus dining, but the lack of comprehensive solutions indicates gaps in available platforms suited to the Kenyan university context—gaps that the proposed Cafeteria Ordering and Loyalty Reward System aims to address.

## 2.4.2 Strathmore University Dining Services (Digital Adaptation Example)

**Overview**

Strathmore University, a private institution in Nairobi known for technology adoption and innovation, represents one of the few Kenyan universities that has implemented elements of digital dining services, making it a valuable local case study. While not a complete mobile ordering solution comparable to the global systems reviewed earlier, Strathmore's approach demonstrates both the possibilities and the current limitations of campus dining digitalization in the Kenyan context.

Strathmore operates multiple dining facilities on its main Nairobi campus including a primary cafeteria, coffee shops, and grab-and-go locations. The university has approximately 4,000-5,000 students (undergraduate and graduate) creating substantial daily dining demand, particularly during the lunch hours between 12:00-2:00 PM when class schedules create concentrated traffic.

**Digital Systems and Features**

Strathmore's dining services utilize a student ID card system integrated with the university's broader campus services platform. Students load funds onto their ID cards (Strathmore Card) at designated points or through online portal payment systems accepting M-Pesa or bank transfers. The card balance then functions as a declining balance account usable across campus services including cafeteria purchases, library printing, vending machines, and access control.

At the point of sale, students tap their ID cards on card readers connected to the cafeteria's point-of-sale system. The system automatically deducts the purchase amount, provides electronic receipts, and tracks transactions for both student account management and cafeteria business analytics. This cashless payment approach eliminates physical cash handling time, improves transaction speed at busy times, and reduces theft or error risks associated with cash management.

The university provides a student portal and mobile app where students can check card balances, view transaction history, and initiate top-ups remotely. This financial transparency helps students budget and avoid unexpected insufficient fund situations. Automated low-balance email/SMS alerts remind students to top up before running out—a thoughtful feature addressing the frustration of reaching the cafeteria payment point only to discover insufficient funds.

For cafeteria management, the system generates detailed sales analytics including revenue by day/week/month, popular items, peak transaction times, and individual transaction records. This data visibility enables more informed decision-making about inventory ordering, menu planning, and staffing allocation during peak periods. Financial reconciliation is simplified through automated systems reducing manual accounting labor.

**Strengths and Positive Outcomes**

The cashless payment system significantly speeds transactions compared to cash handling, particularly during peak hours when seconds per transaction multiply across hundreds of students. Card tap payments typically complete in 2-3 seconds versus 10-20+ seconds for cash transactions requiring counting, change-making, and verification. This throughput improvement materially reduces queue wait times even without other operational changes.

Students report appreciating the convenience of not needing to carry cash specifically for cafeteria purchases, the ability to top up remotely, and the financial tracking that helps budget management. The transparency of seeing exact charges discourages the unethical practice of staff overcharging that can occur in manual cash systems. Parents can remotely load funds onto student cards, ensuring students have meal access even if personal finances are constrained temporarily.

From the institutional perspective, the integrated card system creates operational efficiencies across multiple services (one card for dining, library, access control, etc.), improves financial controls and audit trails, and provides data for campus planning. The reduced cash handling improves staff safety (less cash on premises reducing robbery risk) and eliminates the costs of daily bank deposits.

**Limitations and Unaddressed Needs**

Despite these strengths, Strathmore's system addresses only payment convenience—ordering, menu visibility, wait time management, and customer engagement remain manual and traditional. Students still queue to view menus, communicate orders verbally, wait for preparation, and then process payment. The core bottleneck of sequential ordering at limited service points persists. During very busy periods, the faster payment processing provides only marginal wait time reduction because order communication and preparation consume the majority of service time.

No mobile ordering functionality exists—students cannot browse menus, customize orders, or place orders for scheduled pickup from their smartphones. No loyalty or rewards program incentivizes repeat business or provides recognition to frequent diners. No nutritional information is digitally available for students managing dietary needs. No real-time menu availability updates inform students which items are in stock before they reach the service counter.

The system serves payment and financial management but doesn't transform the fundamental dining experience or create the advanced capabilities seen in the global systems reviewed earlier (Grubhub Campus, CBORD GET). Its existence demonstrates Kenyan university readiness for digital dining services and provides a foundation (student ID cards, payment infrastructure) upon which more comprehensive solutions could build, but significant functionality gaps remain—gaps that the proposed Cafeteria Ordering and Loyalty Reward System is designed to address comprehensively.

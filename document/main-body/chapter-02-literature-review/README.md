## Research Guidelines

### Finding Systems to Review
1. **Academic databases**: Google Scholar, IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library
2. **Industry reports**: Tech blogs, company case studies
3. **University websites**: Check similar institutions
4. **App stores**: Review existing mobile apps
5. **GitHub**: Open-source projects

### What to Look For
- ✅ Systems solving similar problems
- ✅ Different technological approaches
- ✅ Various geographic contexts
- ✅ Both successes and failures
- ✅ Recent systems (last 5-10 years preferred)

### Documentation
- Take screenshots of each system
- Save URLs and access dates
- Record all citation information immediately
- Note specific features worth discussing

## Key Deliverables
- [ ] 6-8 systems identified and reviewed
- [ ] Screenshots/diagrams collected (8-12)
- [ ] Comparison table created
- [ ] All sections drafted
- [ ] Citations properly formatted (APA)
- [ ] Word count verified (~9,500 words)
- [ ] Figures captioned and numbered

## Notes
- This is typically the longest chapter
- Quality over quantity - thorough analysis matters

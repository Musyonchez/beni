# 3.4 Conclusion

This chapter has outlined the aims and objectives that will guide the development of the proposed cafeteria ordering and loyalty reward system for university campuses in Kenya. The general aim of the study was established as the creation of a mobile-based solution to address the inefficiencies and challenges of traditional cafeteria operations, including long queues, manual processes, limited payment options, and lack of customer engagement. This broad aim was then broken down into specific objectives that focus on conducting a literature review to identify best practices, designing and developing a comprehensive mobile ordering system with M-Pesa integration and loyalty rewards, and testing and evaluating the prototype with actual student users.

The formulation of these aims and objectives provides a structured roadmap for the project. They ensure that each stage of the research and development process remains aligned with the central problems identified in Chapter One while also laying the groundwork for the practical design and implementation strategies to follow in Chapter Four. Furthermore, the objectives highlight the project's emphasis on user-centered design, technical robustness through cloud-based architecture, and sustainability through data-driven management capabilities, ensuring that the final solution is both effective and adaptable to the specific needs of university cafeteria operations in the Kenyan context.

# 3.1 Introduction

A successful research or system development project requires a clear sense of direction, which can only be achieved through well-defined aims and objectives. These act as the guiding framework that shapes the overall purpose of the study, the methods adopted, and the outcomes expected. Without properly established aims and objectives, projects risk deviating from their intended purpose, resulting in inefficiency and lack of focus.

In the context of this study, which seeks to address the challenges of cafeteria ordering and customer engagement at university campuses in Kenya, the aims and objectives provide the foundation for ensuring that the proposed solution directly responds to the problems identified in the earlier chapters. The introduction of a mobile-based cafeteria ordering and loyalty reward system requires not only a broad aim that captures the overall vision of the project but also specific objectives that outline the practical steps necessary to realize this vision.

This section therefore introduces the general aim of the study and breaks it down into specific objectives that will guide the design, development, testing, and documentation of the system. Together, they serve as a structured roadmap that ensures the project achieves its intended goals in a systematic and measurable manner.

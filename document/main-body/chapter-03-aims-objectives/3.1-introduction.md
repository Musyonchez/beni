# 3.1 Introduction

The success of any software development project depends fundamentally on establishing clear, well-defined objectives that guide design decisions, implementation priorities, and evaluation criteria. This chapter articulates the aims and objectives of the Cafeteria Ordering and Loyalty Reward System, translating the problems identified in Chapter 1 and the opportunities revealed through the literature review in Chapter 2 into specific, actionable goals that will direct the project's execution.

Objectives serve multiple critical purposes in this project. They provide a roadmap for the development process, helping prioritize features and allocate limited time and resources to the most impactful capabilities. They establish success criteria against which the completed system will be evaluated in Chapter 7, enabling objective assessment of whether the project achieved what it set out to accomplish. They communicate to stakeholders—including potential users, cafeteria administrators, and academic supervisors—exactly what the system intends to deliver, managing expectations and building support. Finally, they create accountability, transforming vague aspirations like "improve the cafeteria experience" into concrete commitments like "reduce average wait time by 50%."

This chapter distinguishes between general aims and specific objectives to provide both strategic direction and tactical clarity. General aims, presented in Section 3.2, articulate the broad goals and intended impacts of the system at a high level—the fundamental purposes it serves and the overarching problems it addresses. These aims are qualitative and strategic, describing what the system should fundamentally accomplish without prescribing exactly how or requiring precise measurement. Specific objectives, detailed in Section 3.3, operationalize these aims into measurable, time-bound deliverables following the SMART framework (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound). These specific objectives can be definitively validated as achieved or not achieved, providing clear evaluation criteria.

The aims and objectives presented in this chapter directly address the problems documented in Chapter 1: long queue wait times, manual ordering inefficiencies, limited payment options, absence of customer engagement mechanisms, lack of pre-ordering capability, and insufficient business intelligence for cafeteria management. They incorporate best practices identified in the literature review while being appropriately scoped for a single academic project with finite resources and a defined timeline. The objectives balance ambition with realism, targeting meaningful improvements to the campus dining experience while remaining technically and practically achievable within the available time frame and development resources.

By clearly defining what success looks like before beginning detailed design and implementation, this chapter ensures that subsequent work remains focused on delivering genuine value rather than pursuing technical sophistication for its own sake. The objectives will be continuously referenced throughout Chapters 4-7 to demonstrate how planning, design, implementation, and testing all align with these defined goals, culminating in a systematic evaluation of achievement in Chapter 7 that determines whether the project successfully fulfilled its intended purpose.

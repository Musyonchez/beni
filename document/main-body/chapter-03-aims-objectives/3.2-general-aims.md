# 3.2 General Aims and Objectives

## Aim 1: Eliminate Queue-Related Wait Times and Improve Student Time Management

The primary aim of this system is to fundamentally transform the cafeteria ordering experience by eliminating the need for students to wait in physical queues during meal periods. Currently, students spend significant portions of their limited break time—often 20 to 40 minutes during peak hours—standing in lines to view menus, place orders, and make payments. This time wastage forces students to choose between adequate nutrition and punctuality to subsequent classes, a trade-off that should not exist in a well-functioning educational environment.

By implementing mobile ordering with scheduled pickup times, the system aims to return this wasted time to students for more productive uses: studying, socializing, resting, or participating in extracurricular activities. The vision is that students open the mobile application during class breaks or even before leaving previous classes, browse menus, customize orders, schedule pickup times that align with their schedules, and pay digitally—all while remaining in their current location. They then arrive at the cafeteria at their chosen pickup time, retrieve ready meals without queuing, and proceed with their day having spent minimal time on the transaction itself while still receiving proper meals.

This aim extends beyond mere convenience to address fundamental student well-being and academic success. Students who skip meals due to queue concerns experience reduced concentration, lower energy levels, and potentially compromised health outcomes. By making meal acquisition efficient and predictable, the system supports students in maintaining proper nutrition without academic penalty, contributing to overall campus quality of life and potentially to improved academic performance.

## Aim 2: Modernize Payment Systems and Expand Payment Options

A secondary but critical aim is to transition the cafeteria from cash-dominant operations to a modern, flexible digital payment ecosystem that accommodates diverse student preferences and financial circumstances. The current cash-heavy model creates inefficiencies (time spent making change, security risks of cash storage, reconciliation overhead), excludes students without sufficient cash on hand, and fails to provide the transaction convenience students experience in other aspects of their digital lives.

The system aims to integrate M-Pesa as a primary payment method, recognizing that mobile money has become the dominant cashless payment system in Kenya with near-universal adoption among smartphone users. By implementing seamless M-Pesa STK push payments, the system enables students to pay directly from their mobile money accounts with the same ease they use for other purchases, eliminating the need to carry cash or visit ATMs specifically for cafeteria use.

Beyond M-Pesa, the system aims to support multiple payment methods including credit/debit cards for students who prefer traditional banking instruments, and potentially integration with student accounts or institutional payment systems where such infrastructure exists. The goal is payment flexibility that serves diverse student populations including local students preferring M-Pesa, international students with foreign cards, and any students with institutional dining accounts.

## Aim 3: Build Customer Engagement and Loyalty Through Rewards

The third major aim is to transform the cafeteria from a purely transactional service into an engaging customer relationship where frequent use is recognized and rewarded. Currently, students who eat at the cafeteria daily receive no acknowledgment or benefits for their loyal patronage, while occasional users are treated identically. This represents a missed opportunity both for fostering positive relationships with regular customers and for creating incentives that drive repeat business.

The loyalty rewards component aims to implement a points-based system where every purchase earns points proportional to spending, accumulated points unlock rewards such as discounts or free items, and tiered membership statuses provide escalating benefits to frequent users. This gamification of cafeteria usage aims to make choosing campus dining feel rewarding rather than merely convenient, building emotional engagement and habit formation.

Beyond immediate transactional rewards, the loyalty system aims to enable personalized experiences. The system can remember favorite orders for quick reordering, suggest items based on past preferences, and provide targeted promotions to individual users based on their behavior patterns. This personalization aims to make students feel recognized as individuals rather than anonymous customers, strengthening their connection to the cafeteria as a valued campus service.

## Aim 4: Enable Data-Driven Cafeteria Management and Operational Intelligence

A fourth aim, while perhaps less visible to students, is equally important for long-term sustainability: providing cafeteria administrators with comprehensive data and analytics that enable evidence-based operational decision-making. The traditional manual system generates minimal actionable data, forcing management to operate on intuition, anecdotal feedback, and rough historical patterns.

The system aims to capture detailed data about every transaction including items ordered, order times, customer patterns, peak demand periods, and revenue attribution. This data, presented through analytics dashboards, aims to empower cafeteria management to optimize inventory ordering (reducing waste and stockouts), refine menu offerings based on popularity data, adjust pricing strategically to maximize revenue while maintaining affordability, and allocate labor efficiently by matching staffing levels to predicted demand.

Furthermore, the system aims to provide customer feedback mechanisms integrated into the digital experience—ratings, reviews, preference signals—that give management rapid insights into satisfaction levels and quality concerns. Rather than discovering problems through complaints or speculation, management can proactively identify and address issues before they become serious, continuously improving service quality based on real user feedback.

This operational intelligence aim serves cafeteria sustainability and institutional value. A data-driven cafeteria can operate more efficiently (lower costs), serve students better (higher satisfaction), and generate surplus revenue that can be reinvested in improved facilities, expanded menu options, or reduced prices—creating a virtuous cycle of improvement enabled by the digital transformation.

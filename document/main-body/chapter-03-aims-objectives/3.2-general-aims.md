# 3.2 General Aims and Objectives

The general aim of this project is to design, develop, and evaluate a mobile-based cafeteria ordering system with AI-powered chatbot specifically for university campuses in Kenya. This initiative seeks to directly address the documented inefficiencies and challenges faced by students and cafeteria staff, including long queue wait times, manual ordering processes, limited payment options, and lack of intelligent customer support. By moving beyond traditional cash-based, queue-dependent operations, the project aims to provide a reliable, user-friendly, AI-enhanced digital solution. Ultimately, this endeavor contributes to the broader strategic goals of enhancing campus dining services and driving digital transformation, thereby improving student welfare and institutional efficiency.

A comprehensive review of existing literature will be conducted to establish a strong theoretical and practical foundation for this project. This survey will critically analyze prior research on mobile ordering systems, digital payment integration, and AI chatbot implementations, with a specific focus on their application within educational and hospitality environments. It will investigate common technological approaches, such as the use of mobile applications, cloud-based databases (Firebase), mobile money APIs (M-Pesa Daraja), natural language processing (NLP) for chatbots, and push notification systems, and evaluate their respective strengths and limitations. Furthermore, the literature review will identify and synthesize the key usability principles, user interface (UI) design patterns, and user experience (UX) criteria that are most critical for the success of similar applications. This process will ensure the project is informed by established best practices and helps to clearly define the research gap that this specific, AI-enhanced solution for Kenyan university cafeterias will fill.

The design and development of the application will be guided by a structured architectural framework to ensure robustness and usability. The system will be conceptualized with a clear separation between the mobile application (frontend), cloud backend infrastructure, AI chatbot service, and administrative interfaces. The backend, built using Firebase, will be responsible for managing core data including user accounts, menu items, orders, transactions, and chatbot conversation logs. The mobile application, developed using Flutter for cross-platform compatibility, will feature an intuitive interface designed for ease of use. Key functionalities to be implemented include menu browsing with images and prices, shopping cart management, order placement with customization options, M-Pesa payment integration, AI-powered chatbot for customer support and personalized menu recommendations, real-time order tracking, and push notifications. An administrative web dashboard will enable cafeteria staff to manage incoming orders, update menu items, and access analytics. The design process will prioritize a user-centered approach, ensuring the final product addresses the specific needs of both students and cafeteria management.

The final phase of the project will involve rigorous testing and evaluation of the developed prototype to validate its effectiveness and readiness for deployment. The testing regimen will encompass both technical performance and user acceptance. Technically, the application will be assessed for the accuracy of its order processing, the reliability of payment transactions, chatbot response accuracy and helpfulness, response time performance, and overall system stability. For user-centric evaluation, a group of representative users (minimum 15 students) will be recruited to participate in usability tests and provide feedback through structured surveys. Key metrics such as task completion time, error rates, chatbot interaction satisfaction, user satisfaction scores, and willingness to adopt the system will be collected and analyzed. The insights gained from this comprehensive evaluation will be used to refine the application and demonstrate the extent to which it meets its core objective of improving the cafeteria ordering experience through intelligent automation.

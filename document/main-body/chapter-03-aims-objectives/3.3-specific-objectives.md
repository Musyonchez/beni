# 3.3 Specific Aims and Objectives

The specific aims and objectives of this project are to:

1. Conduct a literature survey on existing mobile ordering systems, digital payment integration (M-Pesa), and loyalty reward programs in order to identify their strengths and weaknesses.

2. Design and develop a mobile cafeteria ordering and loyalty reward system that provides menu browsing, shopping cart management, order placement, M-Pesa payment integration, loyalty points earning and redemption, real-time order tracking with push notifications, and an administrative dashboard, with a secure and scalable Firebase-based architecture.

3. Test and evaluate the prototype cafeteria ordering system with minimum 15 student users in order to assess the extent to which it resolves the issues of long queues, manual processes, limited payment options, and lack of customer engagement identified above.

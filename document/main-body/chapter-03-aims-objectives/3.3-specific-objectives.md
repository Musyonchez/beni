# 3.3 Specific Aims and Objectives

The following specific objectives operationalize the general aims into measurable, time-bound deliverables following the SMART framework. Each objective is Specific (clearly defined),Measurable (success can be objectively verified), Achievable (realistic given available resources), Relevant (addresses identified problems), and Time-bound (has a defined completion deadline aligned with the project timeline).

## Objective 1: Develop a Functional Mobile Application for Menu Browsing and Ordering

**Objective**: Design and implement a mobile application (Android platform) that enables students to browse the complete cafeteria menu, view item details including descriptions and prices, add items to a shopping cart, customize orders with preferences or special instructions, and submit orders for scheduled pickup—all functional and deployed by Week 8 of the project timeline.

**Measurability**: Success is measured by the existence of a functional Android application installable on student devices that demonstrates complete ordering workflow from menu browsing through order submission. Specific criteria include: minimum 20 menu items displayed with images and prices, functional add-to-cart mechanism, order customization capability, and successful order submission generating confirmation.

**Relevance**: This objective directly addresses the identified problem of time-intensive manual ordering by enabling students to place orders remotely before arriving at the cafeteria, eliminating queue time spent browsing menus and communicating orders.

## Objective 2: Implement M-Pesa Payment Integration for Cashless Transactions

**Objective**: Integrate M-Pesa payment processing using the Daraja API (or equivalent Kenyan mobile money API) to enable students to complete cafeteria purchases directly from mobile money accounts through STK push payment flows, fully functional and tested by Week 9 of the project timeline.

**Measurability**: Success is validated by successful test transactions where users initiate payment through the application, receive STK push prompts on their phones, enter M-Pesa PINs, and receive payment confirmation in the application with transaction records updated in the database. Minimum 10 successful test transactions required for validation.

**Relevance**: This objective addresses the identified limitation of cash-dependent operations by providing the payment method most commonly used among Kenyan smartphone users, eliminating cash handling friction and expanding payment accessibility.

## Objective 3: Create a Loyalty Points System with Earning and Redemption Capabilities

**Objective**: Implement a points-based loyalty program where users automatically earn points for every purchase (1 point per Ksh 10 spent), can view accumulated point balances in their profiles, and can redeem points for rewards (e.g., 100 points = Ksh 50 discount on next order), with full earning and redemption functionality operational by Week 9.

**Measurability**: Success is demonstrated by user profiles correctly displaying point balances that increment with purchases (verified through test transactions), interface elements showing point earning rates, and successful point redemption applying discounts to orders. Minimum 5 complete earn-and-redeem cycles must be demonstrated.

**Relevance**: This objective creates the customer engagement mechanism identified as missing in current operations, incentivizing repeat business and building student loyalty to the campus cafeteria.

## Objective 4: Develop Real-Time Order Tracking and Notification System

**Objective**: Implement order status tracking where students can view their order progression through states (Order Received, Preparing, Ready for Pickup) in real-time, with push notifications sent at key status changes, functional by Week 8.

**Measurability**: Success is verified by students being able to view order status in the application matching actual preparation states managed by cafeteria staff interfaces, and receiving push notifications within 30 seconds of status changes. Test with minimum 10 orders cycled through all status stages.

**Relevance**: This objective addresses student desire for transparency and predictability by providing visibility into order preparation, reducing uncertainty about when to arrive for pickup and building trust in the system.

## Objective 5: Build Administrative Dashboard for Cafeteria Management

**Objective**: Create a web-based administrative interface enabling cafeteria staff to view incoming orders, update order statuses, manage menu items (add/edit/remove/mark unavailable), and access basic analytics (daily orders, revenue, popular items), fully functional by Week 9.

**Measurability**: Success is validated by a functional web dashboard accessible via standard browsers where administrators can successfully perform all specified actions (view orders, update statuses, modify menu items, view reports) with changes reflecting correctly in the student-facing app. All core administrative functions must be demonstrated.

**Relevance**: This objective provides cafeteria management with the operational tools needed to manage digital orders efficiently and access the business intelligence identified as lacking in traditional operations.

## Objective 6: Implement Secure User Authentication and Profile Management

**Objective**: Develop user registration and login functionality with secure password hashing, session management, and user profile management (edit personal information, view order history, manage payment methods), integrated with Firebase Authentication, completed by Week 6.

**Measurability**: Success is confirmed by users being able to register new accounts, login with credentials, maintain authenticated sessions across app sessions, update profile information, and view personalized order histories—all without security vulnerabilities in authentication flows. Minimum 20 test user accounts must be created and validated.

**Relevance**: This objective establishes the foundation for personalized experiences, loyalty tracking, and order attribution essential for both student value and operational analytics.

## Objective 7: Achieve System Performance Targets for User Experience

**Objective**: Optimize system performance to meet defined targets: app launch time under 3 seconds, menu loading under 2 seconds, order submission processing under 5 seconds, all on standard Android devices with 3G internet connectivity—measured and validated by Week 10.

**Measurability**: Success is quantified through performance testing on representative devices (mid-range Android phones, 3G network simulation) measuring actual times for specified operations. All performance targets must be met or exceeded in at least 90% of test runs.

**Relevance**: This objective ensures that the digital solution actually improves rather than degrades the user experience by maintaining responsiveness even under realistic connectivity conditions common in Kenyan environments.

## Objective 8: Conduct User Testing and Achieve Satisfaction Targets

**Objective**: Recruit minimum 15 student volunteers to test the complete system through realistic use scenarios, collect feedback via surveys and interviews, and achieve minimum 75% satisfaction rating (4/5 or higher on satisfaction scale) by Week 10.

**Measurability**: Success measured by documented user testing sessions with at least 15 participants completing full ordering workflows, survey responses collected and analyzed, and calculated average satisfaction score meeting or exceeding the 75% target. Feedback must be documented for future iteration.

**Relevance**: This objective validates that the system actually solves the identified problems from the user perspective, providing evidence that technical implementation successfully translates into improved student experiences.

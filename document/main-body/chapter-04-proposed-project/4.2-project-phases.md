# 4.2 Project Phases

The project is organized into three sequential phases, each with distinct objectives, activities, and deliverables designed to progress systematically from concept to deployed system. This phased approach provides structure to the development process, enables checkpoint evaluations ensuring quality before proceeding, and accommodates the iterative nature of software development where later discoveries may inform refinements to earlier decisions.

## 4.2.1 Phase 1: Research, Requirements Gathering, and System Design (Weeks 1-3)

**Objective**: Establish comprehensive understanding of user needs, technical requirements, and system architecture before beginning implementation, ensuring development efforts build the right system correctly.

**Duration**: 3 weeks (approximately 45-60 hours of effort)

**Key Activities**:

The first phase begins with completion of background research documented as Chapters 1-2 of this report—understanding the problem space through observation of current cafeteria operations, informal interviews with students and cafet

eria staff to validate assumptions, and literature review of existing solutions establishing best practices and common pitfalls. This research phase, largely completed concurrently with early project planning, informs all subsequent design decisions.

Requirements gathering formalizes user needs into specific, testable system requirements. Functional requirements define what the system must do: users shall be able to browse menus, add items to cart, place orders, make payments, earn loyalty points, track order status, and view history. Non-functional requirements specify quality attributes: performance (menu load time <2 seconds), security (encrypted payment information, secure authentication), usability (intuitive interface requiring minimal training), and compatibility (support Android 8.0+, iOS 12+ through Flutter compilation). Requirements are documented in a structured format enabling traceability from need through implementation to testing.

System design translates requirements into technical architecture. The high-level architecture defines major components and their relationships: Flutter mobile application (presentation tier), Firebase Cloud Firestore (data tier), M-Pesa Daraja API (payment integration), and React web dashboard (administrative interface). Detailed design specifies data models for users, menu items, orders, loyalty points, and transactions; defines API contracts between application and backend services; plans database schema including collections, document structures, and indexing strategy; and creates UI/UX wireframes for key screens establishing visual hierarchy and user flows before coding begins.

Technology stack finalization occurs during this phase. While Flutter and Firebase are predetermined strategic choices, specific decisions about state management approach (Provider, Riverpod, or BLoC pattern), navigation framework, UI component libraries, and third-party packages require evaluation and selection based on project needs. A prototype development environment is established and configured: Flutter SDK installation, Android Studio or VS Code setup with Flutter extensions, Firebase project creation and configuration, Daraja API sandbox account registration, and git repository initialization for version control.

**Phase 1 Deliverables**:
- Formalized requirements document with functional and non-functional specifications
- System architecture diagram showing major components and data flows
- Database schema design for Cloud Firestore collections
- UI/UX wireframes for minimum 8-10 key screens (login, menu browsing, cart, checkout, order tracking, profile, loyalty, admin dashboard)
- Technical specification document detailing technology choices and rationale
- Configured development environment ready for coding
- Chapters 1-3 of project report (introduction, literature review, objectives)

**Success Criteria**: Design documents are reviewed and approved by project supervisor, wireframes validated with potential users showing interface comprehensibility, development environment successfully builds and runs a "Hello World" Flutter application connecting to Firebase.

## 4.2.2 Phase 2: Development and Implementation (Weeks 4-8)

**Objective**: Transform design specifications into fully functional mobile application and administrative dashboard, implementing core features iteratively with continuous testing ensuring quality throughout development.

**Duration**: 5 weeks (approximately 75-100 hours of effort)

**Key Activities**:

The development phase follows an iterative approach building features incrementally rather than attempting complete implementation before any testing. This reduces risk of late-stage discovery of fundamental flaws and enables early user feedback incorporation. Development begins with foundational infrastructure: Firebase project configuration including Firestore security rules, authentication setup, and cloud function deployment if needed; basic Flutter project structure establishing folder organization, navigation framework, and state management architecture; and common UI components (buttons, cards, input fields) following consistent design system.

User authentication implementation provides the entry point: Firebase Authentication integration for email/password registration and login, user profile creation in Firestore upon registration, session management maintaining logged-in state across app restarts, and basic profile viewing/editing functionality. This foundational feature enables all subsequent user-specific functionality (order history, loyalty points, personalized preferences).

Core ordering functionality development proceeds through logical increments. Menu browsing displays cafeteria offerings retrieved from Firestore with categories, images, descriptions, and prices; search and filtering enable users to find items efficiently. Shopping cart management allows adding/removing items, adjusting quantities, viewing subtotals including tax/fees if applicable, and applying loyalty point discounts. Order placement captures delivery/pickup preferences, special instructions, and scheduled pickup times, submits orders to Firestore creating order documents, and triggers appropriate workflows (staff notifications, inventory updates).

Payment integration represents the most technically complex component. M-Pesa integration via Daraja API requires: obtaining API credentials and understanding authentication flows (OAuth), implementing STK Push for customer-initiated payments where users receive payment prompts on their phones, handling payment callbacks confirming transaction success/failure, recording payment transactions in Firestore linked to orders, and implementing proper error handling for network failures, insufficient funds, or timeout scenarios. Sandbox testing with test M-Pesa wallets validates payment flows before any real money transactions.

Loyalty points system implementation tracks earned points (automated when payments complete), displays point balances in user profiles, enables point redemption creating discounts on orders, and establishes points expiration policies if required. Order tracking functionality shows real-time order status progression (Received → Preparing → Ready), sends push notifications on status changes using Firebase Cloud Messaging, and provides order history viewing with reorder capability for convenience.

The administrative dashboard development creates web interface for cafeteria staff: order queue display showing pending orders requiring preparation, status management enabling staff to update order states, menu management for adding/editing/removing items and marking items unavailable, basic analytics showing daily orders, revenue, and popular items, and user management if needed for staff access control.

**Phase 2 Deliverables**:
- Functional Flutter mobile application with all core features implemented
- M-Pesa payment integration working in sandbox environment
- Loyalty points earning and redemption functional
- Order tracking with real-time status updates operational
- React/Next.js administrative dashboard deployed
- Firestore database running with proper security rules
- Firebase Authentication active with user registration/login working
- Version control repository with regular commits documenting progress
- Chapter 6 technical documentation (implementation details, code explanations, challenges)

**Success Criteria**: Application runs on physical Android devices without crashes, complete ordering workflow (browse → add to cart → checkout → payment → tracking) functions end-to-end, M-Pesa payments process successfully in sandbox, loyalty points calculate and apply correctly, administrative dashboard displays orders and enables status updates.

## 4.2.3 Phase 3: Testing, Evaluation, and Delivery (Weeks 9-10)

**Objective**: Validate system functionality, performance, and user satisfaction through comprehensive testing, gather user feedback, assess objective achievement, and finalize project documentation for submission.

**Duration**: 2 weeks (approximately 30-40 hours of effort)

**Key Activities**:

The testing phase executes systematic validation across multiple dimensions. Functional testing verifies each feature works correctly: all screens load and display appropriate content, buttons and interactions respond as expected, data saves and retrieves accurately from Firestore, payment processing completes successfully, loyalty points calculate properly, and order status updates reflect in app. Test cases are documented with expected vs. actual outcomes, identifying defects requiring correction.

Performance testing measures system responsiveness: app launch time from tap to first screen display, menu loading time across varying item counts, order submission processing duration, payment API response times, and overall application memory and CPU usage. These metrics are compared against targets defined in Chapter 3 objectives (e.g., <3 second launch time) with optimization if targets aren't met.

Usability testing recruits actual users (minimum 15 student volunteers per Objective 8) to complete realistic scenarios: discover and download the app, create an account, browse menus and selected preferred items, place an order with payment, track order status, and provide feedback via surveys. Observations identify user interface confusion points, navigation difficulties, or workflow friction not apparent to the developer. Satisfaction ratings quantify overall user experience measuring against 75% satisfaction target.

Security testing verifies proper authentication (unauthorized users cannot access protected features), sensitive data protection (passwords hashed, payment information encrypted), and Firestore security rules preventing unauthorized data access. While not penetration testing, basic validation ensures no obvious vulnerabilities.

Bug fixing and refinement address identified issues. Critical bugs blocking core function receive immediate priority, medium-severity usability issues are addressed if time permits, and minor cosmetic issues are documented for potential future improvement but may remain in v1.0 given time constraints. The goal is stable, functional system, not perfection.

Documentation finalization completes all project report chapters: Chapter 4 (this proposed project plan), Chapter 5 (system design diagrams and specifications), Chapter 6 (implementation documentation with code explanations), Chapter 7 (testing results and evaluation), and Chapter 8 (conclusion and reflection). User documentation is created including basic app usage guide and administrative dashboard manual if stakeholders request.

Deployment preparation packages the application for distribution: generating signed APK for Android installation, creating Play Store listing if publishing (optional given academic context), deploying Firebase backend to production environment from development, and documenting deployment process for reproducibility. Final demo/presentation materials are prepared for project presentation.

**Phase 3 Deliverables**:
- Comprehensive test results documentation (functional, performance, usability, security)
- User testing feedback from 15+ participants with satisfaction metrics
- Bug reports with resolution status
- Completed project report chapters 4-8
- User documentation and quick-start guides
- Deployed application (APK or app store link)
- Project presentation slides/demo materials
- Final reflection on objective achievement against Chapter 3 definitions

**Success Criteria**: All critical bugs resolved or documented with workarounds, performance targets from Chapter 3 met or variance explained, user satisfaction ≥75%, all objectives from Chapter 3 assessed with evidence, project report complete and ready for academic submission.

# 4.6 Risk Analysis and Mitigation

Systematic risk identification and mitigation planning is essential for project success. The following analysis identifies potential threats to project completion, assesses their likelihood and impact, and defines mitigation strategies.

## Risk Assessment Matrix

| Risk ID | Risk Description | Probability | Impact | Severity | Mitigation Strategy |
|---------|------------------|-------------|--------|----------|---------------------|
| **R1** | M-Pesa Daraja API integration more complex than anticipated | High | High | **Critical** | Start integration early (Week 7), use sandbox extensively, have backup plan (manual payment recording) |
| **R2** | Firebase free tier limits exceeded during testing | Medium | Medium | **Moderate** | Monitor usage dashboard, optimize queries, implement caching, upgrade to Blaze if necessary (~$10-20) |
| **R3** | Timeline delays due to learning curve (Flutter/Firebase) | High | Medium | **Moderate** | Allocate Week 1-3 for learning, use tutorials/documentation, ask for help early, buffer time in schedule |
| **R4** | Scope creep - attempting too many features | Medium | High | **Critical** | Stick to Chapter 3 objectives strictly, document "future work" instead of implementing, prioritize MVP features |
| **R5** | Insufficient user testers (target: 15+) | Medium | Medium | **Moderate** | Recruit early (Week 8), incentivize participation (free meal voucher?), lower to 10 if necessary |
| **R6** | Critical bugs discovered late (Week 9-10) | Medium | High | **Critical** | Continuous testing during development, code reviews, daily builds, allocate Week 9 for bug fixing |
| **R7** | Device compatibility issues (varied Android versions) | Low | Medium | **Low** | Test on Android 8.0+ minimum, use Flutter's compatibility features, borrow diverse test devices |
| **R8** | Poor internet connectivity affecting app performance | Medium | Medium | **Moderate** | Implement offline caching, show loading states, graceful error handling, test on 3G networks |
| **R9** | Supervisor feedback requires major design changes | Low | High | **Moderate** | Regular check-ins (Week 3, 6, 8), early prototypes for feedback, maintain design flexibility |
| **R10** | Personal circumstances (illness, emergencies) | Low | High | **Moderate** | Build 1-week buffer into timeline, maintain daily git commits, document everything for continuity |

## Detailed Mitigation Plans

### R1: M-Pesa Integration Complexity (Critical)

**Why it's a risk**: Daraja API requires OAuth authentication, callback URL handling, and dealing with async payment confirmation. Documentation can be sparse for edge cases.

**Mitigation**:
- **Week 4**: Register for Daraja sandbox, obtain credentials early
- **Week 6**: Start STK Push integration testing (before full app ready)
- **Week 7**: Dedicated week for payment integration only
- **Backup plan**: If Daraja proves impossible, implement "cash payment" option with manual confirmation by staff
- **Resources**: Join M-Pesa developer forums, study existing Flutter+Daraja examples on GitHub

### R4: Scope Creep (Critical)

**Why it's a risk**: Enthusiasm to add features like ratings, reviews, group ordering, meal planning, etc. can derail core functionality delivery.

**Mitigation**:
- Strictly prioritize 8 objectives from Chapter 3
- Mark extras as "Future Work" in Chapter 8
- Use "won't implement" list: QR code scanning, AI recommendations, social features
- If ahead of schedule Week 7: add ONE bonus feature maximum
- Weekly self-reviews: "Does this align with objectives?"

### R6: Late-Stage Critical Bugs (Critical)

**Why it's a risk**: Discovering bugs in Week 10 leaves no time for fixes before submission.

**Mitigation**:
- Test each feature immediately after implementing (don't accumulate test debt)
- Daily builds on physical device (not just emulator)
- Peer code review with classmate (Week 6, 8)
- Dedicated Week 9 for bug fixing (no new features)
- Maintain bug tracking list with priorities
- Accept minor bugs if critical functionality works

### R3: Learning Curve Delays (Moderate)

**Why it's a risk**: First time using Flutter, Firebase, and Daraja API simultaneously.

**Mitigation**:
- **Week 1**: Complete Flutter basics course (free online)
- **Week 2**: Firebase + Flutter tutorial
- **Week 3**: Build simple CRUD app as practice
- Use official documentation as primary resource
- Join Flutter Discord/Stack Overflow for quick help
- Don't reinvent wheel - use packages (provider, dio, etc.)

### R2: Firebase Free Tier Limits (Moderate)

**Why it's a risk**: Free tier allows 50K reads/day, 20K writes/day. User testing with 15 people could spike usage.

**Mitigation**:
- Monitor Firebase usage dashboard daily (Week 7+)
- Implement client-side caching (reduce reads)
- Optimize Firestore queries (use indexes, limit results)
- Schedule user testing across 2 days (reduce parallel load)
- Budget $10-20 for Blaze plan upgrade if needed (still minimal cost)
- Use emulator for personal testing (doesn't count toward quota)

### R5: Insufficient User Testers (Moderate)

**Why it's a risk**: Need 15+ users for statistically meaningful satisfaction measurement (Objective 8).

**Mitigation**:
- Recruit early: Week 8 announcement in class, social media
- Incentivize: Offer free meal voucher or entry into prize draw
- Make testing easy: 15-minute sessions, on-campus setup help
- Lower bar if necessary: 10 users acceptable (adjust target in Chapter 7)
- Use classmates, friends, family as backup testers

### R8: Poor Connectivity Performance (Moderate)

**Why it's a risk**: Campus WiFi can be unreliable; mobile data may be slow 3G in some areas.

**Mitigation**:
- Test on actual 3G connection (disable WiFi, use mobile data)
- Implement aggressive image caching (menu photos)
- Show loading states, don't freeze UI
- Graceful degradation: offline menu browsing, sync when connected
- Optimize Firestore queries (small result sets)
- Compress images (<200KB each)

## Contingency Scenarios

### Scenario A: Week 7 - M-Pesa Integration Failing

**Trigger**: 3+ days of effort, still can't get STK Push working  
**Response**:
1. Switch to "Cash/Manual Payment" mode for demo
2. Show Daraja integration attempt in Chapter 6 (implementation)
3. Document technical challenge in Chapter 8 (challenges section)
4. Still demonstrates ordering flow, just not automated payment

### Scenario B: Week 9 - Behind Schedule on Testing

**Trigger**: Week 9 arrives, still bugs or missing features  
**Response**:
1. Triage: Fix critical bugs only (app crashes, data loss)
2. Accept minor bugs (UI glitches, slow animations)
3. Reduce user testing to 10 participants
4. Focus on completing report chapters (deliverable matters)

### Scenario C: Week 6 - Ahead of Schedule

**Trigger**: Core features done early  
**Response**:
1. Start M-Pesa integration early (de-risk R1)
2. Add polish: animations, better UI, error messages
3. Build admin dashboard ahead of schedule
4. Don't add scope - improve quality of existing features

# 4.1 Introduction

The Cafeteria Ordering and Loyalty Reward System represents a comprehensive digital transformation of campus dining services, addressing the problems documented in Chapter 1 through a mobile-first solution that integrates ordering, payment, and customer engagement within a unified platform. This chapter outlines the proposed approach to developing this system, detailing the project phases, timeline, resource requirements, and risk management strategies that will guide implementation from conception through deployment and evaluation.

The project adopts an agile, iterative development methodology appropriate for a solo academic project with a 10-week timeline. Rather than attempting to build all features simultaneously, development will proceed through three clearly defined phases: Research and Design (Weeks 1-3), Development and Implementation (Weeks 4-8), and Testing and Evaluation (Weeks 9-10). Each phase has specific deliverables and success criteria, ensuring measurable progress throughout the project period and enabling early identification of challenges requiring adjustment.

The technical approach centers on modern, cross-platform mobile development using **Flutter**, Google's UI toolkit for building natively compiled applications from a single codebase. This strategic choice enables development of a high-quality mobile application for both iOS and Android platforms simultaneously, maximizing potential user reach while minimizing development effort—critical for a solo developer within an academic timeline. Flutter's hot reload functionality accelerates development iterations, extensive widget library simplifies UI creation, and strong integration with Firebase provides backend infrastructure without requiring separate server development.

The backend infrastructure leverages **Firebase**, Google's comprehensive mobile and web application development platform, providing cloud-hosted database (Cloud Firestore), user authentication, cloud functions for serverless logic, and cloud storage—all managed services requiring no server administration, perfectly suited to academic project constraints. Payment processing integrates **M-Pesa through the Daraja API**, enabling mobile money transactions essential for Kenyan student adoption. The administrative dashboard will be developed as a responsive web application using **React** or **Next.js**, providing cafeteria staff with order management and analytics capabilities accessible from any device.

This technology stack balances sophistication with pragmatism. All core tools are free for educational use or offer generous free tiers sufficient for a university cafeteria: Firebase Spark Plan supports development and small-scale deployment at no cost, Flutter framework and development tools are open-source and free, M-Pesa Daraja sandbox environment enables testing without transaction costs, and hosting can leverage free tiers from Vercel or Firebase Hosting. The estimated total project cost remains under $50-100, limited primarily to potential Android Play Store registration ($25 one-time fee) and minimal testing device needs if personal smartphone is insufficient.

The solo developer model, while limiting team dynamics and parallel workstreams, provides complete creative control, eliminates coordination overhead, and ensures consistent design vision throughout the project. Time allocation reflects realistic solo development capacity: approximately 15-20 hours per week across the 10-week period, totaling 150-200 hours of development effort. This intensity is sustainable within an academic context where this project likely represents a major course component but students balance multiple concurrent coursework demands.

Risk management receives explicit attention through systematic identification of technical, operational, and timeline risks with defined mitigation strategies. Key risks include M-Pesa API integration complexity, Firebase free tier limitations under load testing, timeline pressure affecting quality, and potential user adoption barriers. Each identified risk has associated mitigation approaches detailed in Section 4.6, ensuring proactive rather than reactive problem-solving.

The following sections elaborate this project plan with increasing specificity: Section 4.2 outlines the three major phases and their objectives; Section 4.3 breaks each phase into detailed activities and deliverables; Section 4.4 presents the week-by-week timeline with milestones and dependencies clearly marked; Section 4.5 specifies all required resources organized by category; and Section 4.6 analyzes risks systematically with probability and impact assessments informing mitigation priorities.

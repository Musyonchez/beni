## Quality Checks

### Before Submission
- [ ] Every in-text citation has a reference
- [ ] Every reference was actually cited
- [ ] All URLs work
- [ ] All DOIs included where available
- [ ] Consistent formatting throughout
- [ ] Access dates included for web sources
- [ ] Page numbers included where required
- [ ] Edition numbers for books
- [ ] Volume and issue numbers for journals

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
- ❌ Citing sources you haven't read
- ❌ Missing access dates for websites
- ❌ Inconsistent formatting
- ❌ Wikipedia as a primary source (use its references instead)
- ❌ Broken URLs
- ❌ Missing author/date information

## Notes
- Start collecting references from day one
- Use a reference manager - don't format manually
- Quality over quantity (but 15-25 is a good range)
- Cite all significant sources, even documentation
- Academic honesty is critical - when in doubt, cite
- Check your institution's specific requirements

CHAPTER ONE: INTRODUCTION

Universities are dynamic environments that host thousands of students, staff, and visitors daily.
Navigating large campuses can often be confusing, especially for new students and first-time
visitors unfamiliar with the layout. United States International University – Africa (USIU-A), as a
leading institution of higher learning in the region, has a wide range of academic buildings,
administrative offices, recreational facilities, and service points that can be challenging to locate.
While general navigation tools such as Google Maps offer effective street-level guidance, they
lack the detail and customization required for campus-specific navigation. They do not provide
floor-level directions, building descriptions, or service-specific details tailored to the unique
environment of USIU. This gap creates a need for a dedicated campus navigation system that is
user-friendly, precise, and tailored to the institution’s context.
The emergence of mobile technologies and mapping platforms has made it possible to design
applications that combine real-time positioning with location-specific data. Leveraging these
technologies, this project seeks to develop a Campus Navigation and Mapping Application
specifically designed for USIU-A to improve accessibility, save time, and enhance the user
experience within the university.
1.1

History

The evolution of navigation systems has been closely linked to the advancement of digital
technologies and mobile computing. Traditionally, individuals relied on printed maps, physical
signage, and verbal directions to find their way within large or unfamiliar environments. While
effective to some extent, these methods were often prone to limitations such as outdated
information, lack of precision, and user confusion, particularly in complex settings like university
campuses.
The introduction of Global Positioning System (GPS) technology in the late 20th century
revolutionized navigation by enabling real-time positioning anywhere on Earth. This innovation
was quickly adopted in commercial applications, leading to the development of popular digital
platforms such as Google Maps, Apple Maps, and Waze. These tools made it possible for
individuals to access instant directions, calculate routes, and navigate efficiently within cities,
towns, and transportation networks. However, they were primarily designed for outdoor use and

broad geographical coverage, leaving a gap in specialized environments such as hospitals,
shopping malls, and academic institutions.
Over the years, universities worldwide have recognized the need to develop campus-specific
navigation systems. For example, some institutions in the United States and Europe have piloted
applications that combine GPS data with building-level mapping to help students and visitors
locate lecture halls, libraries, and administrative offices. These systems often integrate additional
features such as event notifications, shuttle tracking, and emergency alerts, contributing to the
concept of “smart campuses.”
In the African context, the adoption of digital navigation tools has grown rapidly, driven by
increased smartphone penetration and the availability of affordable internet services. However,
most universities in the region still rely on traditional signage and printed maps, with limited efforts
made towards implementing digital solutions. At United States International University – Africa
(USIU-A), navigation challenges remain a common concern among new students, visitors, and
even staff, despite the institution’s reputation as a leader in digital transformation.
This history highlights the gradual shift from traditional navigation methods to advanced,
technology-driven systems. It also emphasizes the existing gap in localized, campus-specific
navigation applications, thereby justifying the need for a dedicated system tailored to the USIU-A
environment.
1.2

Problem statement

Navigating a university campus is often a complex task, particularly for new students, staff
members, and first-time visitors. United States International University – Africa (USIU-A) has a
relatively large and diverse campus environment with multiple academic blocks, administrative
offices, recreational facilities, student service centers, and specialized buildings. Despite the
availability of signposts and orientation sessions, many individuals continue to experience
difficulty in locating specific destinations within the institution. This challenge results in wasted
time, missed appointments, and unnecessary frustration, which negatively impacts the overall
campus experience.
Existing navigation solutions, such as Google Maps, offer only general outdoor navigation and do
not provide detailed, campus-specific guidance. While these tools can direct a user to the
2|Page

university’s main gate or external landmarks, they lack the precision to navigate within the campus
boundaries effectively. They also do not provide contextual details such as building names, their
functions, or services offered. For instance, while a user might be directed to the general location
of the Student Center, they may still struggle to identify specific offices or departments within that
building.
The absence of a dedicated campus navigation tool creates barriers not only for students but also
for staff and external visitors. New students often find it difficult to identify lecture halls during
their first weeks of study, while visitors attending seminars, workshops, or administrative
appointments may arrive late due to confusion about where facilities are located. This inefficiency
disrupts learning, service delivery, and general institutional operations.
There is, therefore, a clear need for a customized, user-friendly mobile navigation application
designed specifically for the USIU-A campus. Such a system should not only allow users to search
and locate buildings but also provide guided routes and essential details about each facility.
Addressing this problem will significantly enhance accessibility, improve time management, and
contribute to the broader goal of creating a smart, technology-driven campus environment.
1.3

Conclusion

In summary, this chapter has introduced the proposed project by outlining the context within which
the study is situated and the challenges it seeks to address. It has been established that navigation
within USIU-Africa remains a significant concern for students, staff, and visitors, particularly
because existing commercial solutions such as Google Maps are not designed to provide accurate,
campus-specific guidance. The lack of a tailored system results in inefficiencies, time wastage,
and inconvenience that negatively affect the day-to-day operations of the university community.
By clearly stating the problem and highlighting the gap in current solutions, this chapter has
justified the need for the development of a customized mobile-based campus navigation
application. The application will serve as a dedicated tool that provides precise directions, facility
information, and user-friendly interaction tailored to the unique environment of USIU-Africa.
The conclusions drawn here set the foundation for the subsequent chapters. The next sections of
this proposal will provide an in-depth review of related literature, present the methodology to be
adopted, and outline the design, implementation, and evaluation strategies for the system.
3|Page

Together, these components aim to demonstrate how the proposed application will provide a
practical solution to the identified problem and contribute to the university’s broader vision of
digital innovation and smart campus development.

Introduction

The purpose of a literature review is to examine existing knowledge, systems, and research that
relate to the proposed study. By exploring global, regional, and local contexts, this chapter
highlights how navigation technologies have evolved, their adoption in educational institutions,
and the challenges that remain. The review also identifies gaps that justify the development of a
customized navigation application for United States International University – Africa (USIU-A).
2.2

Global Perspective

Globally, navigation systems have developed significantly over the past three decades, particularly
with the rise of GPS-based services. Applications such as Google Maps, Apple Maps, and Waze
are now widely used for real-time route planning and location-based services. These tools have
proven effective in urban mobility, tourism, and logistics by offering turn-by-turn navigation,
traffic updates, and estimated time of arrival.
Within universities, several institutions in North America and Europe have integrated digital
navigation tools into their campus services. For instance, some universities have implemented
mobile applications that allow students to search for lecture halls, offices, and libraries, often
combined with class schedules or campus events. According to research studies, the
implementation of campus-specific navigation systems contributes to improved time management,
reduced anxiety among new students, and better utilization of campus resources. Despite this
progress, most global solutions remain tailored to outdoor navigation and require significant
customization before they can meet the needs of specific institutions.
2.2.1

MIT WhereIs (Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA)

The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) developed WhereIs, a digital campus navigation
system that has become a benchmark for other universities globally. This system provides an
interactive map of the entire MIT campus, including classrooms, laboratories, dormitories, offices,
libraries, and service facilities. Users can search for specific buildings or services and generate
walking directions to navigate the large and complex campus. The platform integrates detailed
building floor plans, which makes it especially useful for new students and visitors unfamiliar with
the campus layout. Because MIT attracts a global community of students, staff, and researchers,
5|Page

the navigation system is widely used by international users and demonstrates how technology can
simplify movement within a large academic environment.

The innovation seen in the NUS system highlights the potential of combining real-time data and
spatial mapping for improved campus mobility. By merging navigation with transport information,
8|Page

NUS demonstrates a holistic approach that goes beyond static maps. For the USIU Campus
Navigation System, this serves as a valuable model to emulate—particularly the inclusion of
dynamic features such as live location tracking, estimated time of arrival (ETA) functions, and
route optimization. Incorporating such elements would make the USIU system not only a
navigation aid but also an intelligent mobility platform that enhances convenience, time
management, and user satisfaction across the campus community.
2.3

Regional Perspective

In the African context, digital transformation is steadily expanding due to increased smartphone
penetration and internet accessibility. However, the integration of smart navigation systems in
universities remains limited. Most institutions continue to rely on printed maps, signage, or
orientation programs to guide new students and visitors. While some African universities have
adopted e-learning platforms and digital communication tools, fewer have invested in specialized
navigation

systems.

Research shows that one of the main barriers to the adoption of campus-specific navigation
applications in Africa is the cost of implementation and maintenance, as well as limited technical
expertise in some institutions. Nonetheless, as the concept of “smart campuses” gains ground,
more universities are beginning to explore the integration of digital solutions for navigation, safety,
and administrative services. This provides an opportunity for USIU-A, a technology-driven
institution, to pioneer a campus navigation application that can serve as a model for other

learning environment.
However, while the system’s structure is user-friendly and technologically advanced compared to
many local institutions, its static nature limits the full potential of location-based interaction. The
absence of real-time navigation and GPS functionality means that users must rely primarily on
visual orientation rather than live guidance. This restricts the system’s usefulness in providing turnby-turn directions or assisting new students and visitors in locating precise destinations across the
campus. Despite these constraints, the platform remains an important milestone in Kenya’s digital
campus transformation journey, signaling a shift toward smart campus management systems that
prioritize efficiency, accessibility, and digital inclusion.

For the USIU Campus Navigation System, the Strathmore model provides an excellent foundation
to build upon. It illustrates the benefits of system integration, cross-platform accessibility, and
intuitive design. However, it also reveals opportunities for innovation—specifically through realtime GPS guidance, route optimization, and interactive feedback features. By incorporating these
advancements, the USIU system could go beyond static mapping to create a dynamic, locationaware solution that not only enhances campus mobility but also contributes to a smarter and more
connected university ecosystem.

Analysis
Table 1 above presents the strengths and weaknesses of various existing campus navigation
systems, ranging from global solutions such as MIT WhereIs and NUS NextBus, to regional
platforms like UCT Campus Maps and UNILAG Campus Navigator, and local initiatives including
UoN Wayfinding Maps and Strathmore Smart Campus Map. Based on this evaluation, clear gaps
and opportunities are visible in the current campus navigation landscape.
20 | P a g e

Global systems are highly advanced, featuring real-time mapping, integration with transport
networks, and sophisticated data visualization. However, their complexity, high cost, and need for
continuous technical support make them less practical for smaller or mid-sized institutions.
Conversely, regional and local systems are simpler and more accessible, offering cost-effective
solutions and localized relevance but lacking in real-time functionality, automation, and
scalability.
This discrepancy highlights the need for a balanced, context-aware campus navigation solution
that integrates the best features of global systems (like real-time mapping and data accuracy) while
maintaining the simplicity and affordability of local platforms.
The proposed USIU-Africa Campus Navigation System aims to fill this gap by delivering a GPSenabled, mobile-responsive platform designed for university environments. It emphasizes realtime location tracking, user-friendly interfaces, and accessibility for students, visitors, and staff.
Unlike static maps or externally hosted solutions, this system will be modular, easy to update, and
tailored to the specific layout and infrastructure of the campus.
By focusing on interactivity, accessibility, and localized design, the system will transform the
campus experience—simplifying navigation, enhancing accessibility, and reducing time spent
searching for facilities. This positions USIU-Africa as a leader in smart campus innovation within
the region.
2.6

Conclusion

The literature reviewed demonstrates that while navigation technology has advanced globally,
localized applications for universities are still underdeveloped, particularly in Africa. By
addressing this gap, the proposed system will not only improve campus accessibility but also
position USIU-A as a leader in adopting innovative, technology-driven solutions.

CHAPTER THREE: AIMS AND OBJECTIVES

3.1

Introduction

A successful research or system development project requires a clear sense of direction, which can
only be achieved through well-defined aims and objectives. These act as the guiding framework
that shapes the overall purpose of the study, the methods adopted, and the outcomes expected.
Without properly established aims and objectives, projects risk deviating from their intended
purpose, resulting in inefficiency and lack of focus.
In the context of this study, which seeks to address navigation challenges within United States
International University – Africa (USIU-A), the aims and objectives provide the foundation for
ensuring that the proposed solution directly responds to the problem identified in the earlier
chapters. The introduction of a mobile-based campus navigation application requires not only a
broad aim that captures the overall vision of the project but also specific objectives that outline the
practical steps necessary to realize this vision.
This section therefore introduces the general aim of the study and breaks it down into specific
objectives that will guide the design, development, testing, and documentation of the system.
Together, they serve as a structured roadmap that ensures the project achieves its intended goals in
a systematic and measurable manner.
3.2

General Aims and Objectives

The general aim of this project is to design, develop, and evaluate a mobile-based campus
navigation system specifically for United States International University – Africa (USIU-A). This
initiative seeks to directly address the documented inefficiencies and challenges faced by students,
staff, and visitors in locating facilities across the campus. By moving beyond traditional methods
like static maps and physical signage, the project aims to provide a reliable, user-friendly, and
campus-specific digital solution. Ultimately, this endeavor contributes to the broader strategic
goals of enhancing campus accessibility and driving digital transformation, thereby positioning
USIU-A as a forward-thinking, smart campus within the landscape of higher education.
A comprehensive review of existing literature will be conducted to establish a strong theoretical
and practical foundation for this project. This survey will critically analyze prior research on
mobile navigation systems, with a specific focus on their application within educational
22 | P a g e

environments. It will investigate common technological approaches, such as the use of GPS, GIS,
and beacon technology, and evaluate their respective strengths and limitations. Furthermore, the
literature review will identify and synthesize the key usability principles, user interface (UI) design
patterns, and user experience (UX) criteria that are most critical for the success of similar
applications. This process will ensure the project is informed by established best practices and
helps to clearly define the research gap that this specific, context-aware solution for USIU-A will
fill.
The design and development of the application will be guided by a structured architectural
framework to ensure robustness and usability. The system will be conceptualized with a clear
separation between the backend and frontend components. The backend will be responsible for
managing the core data, including detailed campus maps, building footprints, points of interest
(POIs), and efficient pathfinding algorithms. The frontend, developed as a mobile application, will
feature an intuitive interface designed for ease of use. Key functionalities to be implemented
include interactive maps, a searchable directory of campus facilities, and step-by-step navigation
instructions. The design process will prioritize a user-centered approach, ensuring the final product
is tailored to the specific layout and needs of the USIU-A campus.
The final phase of the project will involve rigorous testing and evaluation of the developed
prototype to validate its effectiveness and readiness for deployment. The testing regimen will
encompass both technical performance and user acceptance. Technically, the application will be
assessed for the accuracy of its navigation routes, the speed of its search functionality, and its
overall stability. For user-centric evaluation, a group of representative users (students, staff, and
visitors) will be recruited to participate in usability tests and provide feedback through structured
surveys. Key metrics such as task completion time, error rates, and user satisfaction scores will be
collected and analyzed. The insights gained from this comprehensive evaluation will be used to
refine the application and demonstrate the extent to which it meets its core objective of improving
campus navigation.

3.3

CHAPTER FOUR: PROPOSED PROJECT

4.1

Introduction

The development of any software system requires a structured and systematic approach that
ensures the final product meets both user needs and technical requirements. One of the most
effective ways of achieving this is by organizing the project into distinct phases that guide the
progression of work from the initial idea to the final deployment. Each phase plays a critical role
in reducing risks, clarifying objectives, and ensuring that the project maintains focus throughout
its lifecycle.
For the proposed campus navigation system at United States International University – Africa
(USIU-A), the project has been divided into a series of phases that align with standard software
development practices while also reflecting the unique requirements of this study. These phases
provide a step-by-step pathway that begins with research and requirements analysis, advances
through design and implementation, and concludes with testing, evaluation, deployment, and
documentation.
The purpose of this chapter is to present these proposed phases in detail, highlighting the activities
carried out in each stage, their significance, and the expected outcomes. By structuring the project
into clear phases, it becomes possible to manage resources effectively, monitor progress, and
ensure that the final system is robust, user-friendly, and sustainable.
4.2

Project Phases

The successful development of the USIU-A campus navigation system depends on a carefully
structured process that divides the project into manageable phases. Each phase represents a critical
stage in the system’s lifecycle, ensuring that the final product is both technically sound and usercentered. The phases follow a logical sequence beginning with research, moving through
requirements gathering, design, implementation, and testing, before concluding with evaluation,
deployment, and documentation.
4.2.1

Phase 1: Research Requirements Gathering and System Design

i. Research

25 | P a g e

The first activity in this phase is research, which lays the foundation for the USIU Campus
Navigation System project. It involves reviewing both global and regional campus navigation
platforms to identify best practices, strengths, and existing limitations. Global systems such as
MIT WhereIs and NUS Campus Map with NextBus provide insights into features like interactive
maps, route generation, and transport integration. On a regional scale, platforms such as the
University of Cape Town campus maps and University of Nairobi wayfinding maps reveal the
challenges of limited interactivity, basic layouts, and lack of real-time functionality. In addition,
primary research will be conducted through surveys and interviews with USIU students, staff, and
visitors to capture the unique navigation challenges faced on campus, such as finding classrooms,
offices, or service centers in a timely manner.
ii. Requirements gathering
The second activity is requirements gathering, which transforms user needs into actionable system
specifications. The functional requirements include searching for specific buildings, generating
walking routes, viewing building details, and allowing administrators to update facility
information. Non-functional requirements will focus on usability, system responsiveness,
accessibility, scalability, and security. These requirements will be carefully analyzed, prioritized,
and documented in a Software Requirements Specification (SRS) to serve as a guide for
development. This ensures that the system is aligned with the realities of USIU’s environment and
addresses current limitations in campus orientation and accessibility.
iii. Proposal
The third activity is the preparation of the project proposal, which consolidates the research
findings and requirements into a structured plan. The proposal clearly defines the system
objectives, scope, methodology, and expected outcomes. It also justifies the project by highlighting
the gaps in existing solutions, particularly the absence of an interactive and real-time navigation
system within USIU. By presenting how the system will address these gaps, the proposal ensures
a shared understanding among stakeholders and provides a reference framework for monitoring
progress throughout the project’s lifecycle.
iv. System Architecture and Design
26 | P a g e

The final activity in this phase is system architecture and design, which defines the structural and
logical blueprint of the USIU Campus Navigation System. This includes creating use case
diagrams to represent user interactions, data flow diagrams (DFDs) to illustrate the flow of
information, and an entity-relationship diagram (ERD) to design the database structure. The
system architecture will also specify the integration of the frontend (mobile/web application), the
backend (API server), and the database (relational database such as PostgreSQL or MySQL), along
with external services like Google Maps API for route generation. These design artifacts provide
a roadmap for implementation, ensuring the system is technically sound, user-friendly, and aligned
with project goals.
4.2.2

Phase Two: System Development / Implementation

i. System Frontend
The system frontend will be developed as a mobile and web application using React for modularity,
responsiveness, and cross-platform compatibility. The frontend will provide students, staff, and
visitors with a clean and intuitive user interface that emphasizes simplicity and ease of use. Key
features of the frontend include the ability to search for buildings, lecture halls, offices, or facilities,
view interactive maps, and generate step-by-step walking routes across campus. The design will
follow a structured layout with accessible navigation menus, clear icons, and interactive map
features to ensure users can engage with the system effectively without requiring technical
expertise. Special attention will be placed on responsive design so that the system functions
seamlessly on mobile phones, tablets, and desktops.
ii. System Backend
The system backend will be implemented using Node.js with Express, providing the core business
logic and ensuring smooth communication between the frontend and the database. The backend
will handle functions such as user authentication, map data management, search queries, and route
generation. It will also provide RESTful APIs to enable real-time communication with the
frontend, ensuring that user actions, such as searching for a location or requesting a route, are
executed reliably and securely. Scalability will be prioritized in the backend architecture so that
the system can support future growth, including potential integrations with shuttle bus schedules,
campus event data, or third-party services.
27 | P a g e

iii. Database
The database will be developed using PostgreSQL, a relational database management system
(RDBMS) suited for handling structured and spatial data. PostgreSQL will manage core entities
such as buildings, facilities, classrooms, offices, user accounts, and navigation routes. The
database design will follow an entity-relationship model (ERD) to ensure data integrity and
minimize redundancy. Since the project involves location data, PostgreSQL’s PostGIS extension
may be leveraged to handle geospatial queries and mapping functionality. In addition, indexing
and query optimization will be implemented to improve performance, particularly during complex
searches and when generating shortest-path routes across campus.
iv. System Integration
The system integration process will ensure that the frontend, backend, and database operate
together seamlessly. RESTful APIs will act as the communication bridge, allowing the frontend to
retrieve map data, building details, and navigation routes from the backend. Integration testing will
be conducted to verify that each system component interacts correctly, especially during critical
operations such as searching for a building, displaying its location, and generating a walking path.
Continuous integration practices will be applied to ensure that updates and changes to the system
do not disrupt its overall functionality, maintaining stability throughout development.
v. Core Functionality Implementation
This phase will focus on implementing the core functionalities that define the USIU Campus
Navigation System. These include interactive campus maps, building search functionality, realtime route generation, and facility details (e.g., offices, lecture halls, and student services).
Additional features such as user-friendly map markers, accessibility routes for individuals with
mobility needs, and administrative dashboards for updating building or facility information will
also be implemented. By prioritizing these features, the project ensures that the Minimum Viable
Product (MVP) directly addresses USIU’s navigation challenges, making it easier for students,
staff, and visitors to orient themselves on campus. This foundation will also allow for future
expansions, such as integration with shuttle services, event locations, and emergency safety
features.
28 | P a g e

4.2.3

Phase Three: Testing, Documentation, And Presentation

i. Software Testing and Evaluation
The first step in this phase will involve unit testing, which will focus on verifying the smallest
individual components of the system, such as frontend search forms, backend API endpoints, and
database queries. Each unit will be tested independently to confirm that it performs its intended
function correctly. For instance, the building search form will be tested to ensure that it retrieves
accurate building details, while the database will be tested to confirm that it stores and retrieves
location data correctly. Unit testing at this stage will help identify and fix errors early, reducing
the cost of resolving issues later in the development process.
The next activity will be integration testing, which evaluates the interactions between the frontend,
backend, and database. This ensures that the various system components work together seamlessly.
Key scenarios, such as a student searching for a lecture hall, retrieving its location, and generating
a walking route, will be tested end-to-end. Integration testing will confirm that data flows smoothly
across the system and that the navigation experience is stable and reliable under different
conditions.
Following this, system testing will be performed to evaluate the platform as a whole. This will
include testing functional requirements (such as searching for buildings, displaying map locations,
and generating walking paths) and non-functional requirements (such as response speed, usability,
security, and scalability). The goal of this stage is to confirm that the USIU Campus Navigation
System performs reliably under real-world conditions and aligns with the requirements set out in
the Software Requirements Specification (SRS).
Finally, User Acceptance Testing (UAT) will be conducted to involve actual USIU students, staff,
and visitors in evaluating the system. Test participants will be asked to perform tasks such as
searching for specific classrooms, generating routes to offices, or locating facilities like the library
or cafeteria. Their feedback will be collected and analyzed to refine usability, enhance the user
experience, and validate that the system effectively addresses the navigation challenges it was
designed to solve. By the end of this stage, the system will be validated against its objectives and
prepared for deployment.
29 | P a g e

ii. Project Write-Up
All research findings, methodologies, system designs, implementation details, and testing results
will be documented in a formal academic report. This write-up ensures that the USIU Campus
Navigation System is well-documented for academic evaluation and also serves as a reference for
potential future enhancements, scaling, or integration with other university systems such as
transport services, event management, or emergency response systems.
iii. Final Presentation and Submission
The USIU Campus Navigation System will be presented to stakeholders, including lecturers, peers,
and representatives of the student community. This final presentation will demonstrate the
navigation challenges addressed, showcase the system’s features such as interactive maps and
route generation, and highlight its impact on improving orientation and accessibility at USIU. The
demonstration will validate the project’s success, confirm its contribution to solving real student
challenges, and present opportunities for further expansion. The final report and system prototype
will then be submitted for academic evaluation and assessment.
4.3

Tasks within a project can be planned, scheduled, and their progress monitored using a Gantt chart,
a visual project management tool. The Gantt chart functions as a comprehensive roadmap for the
Asset Recovery System, outlining every stage of the project lifecycle, from planning and research
to development, testing, and final presentation. By dividing the project into three primary stages,
the chart facilitates efficient time management , defining task dependencies, setting start and finish
dates, and emphasising important milestones.
The project will remain on course and all deliverables will be finished within the allotted time
thanks to this well-organized timeline.

36 | P a g e

Figure 11: Gantt chart

Figure 11 above shows the Gantt chart that also highlights task dependencies and overlaps,
providing a visual understanding of how activities are interrelated. This helps with effective project
management by identifying critical paths and resource allocation needs. By following this
structured plan, the development team can stay organized, minimize delays, and deliver the system
within the projected timeframe. Moreover, the Gantt chart serves as a valuable tool for tracking
progress and facilitating communication among team members. It enables regular updates and
adjustments to the project schedule, ensuring that any risks or delays are identified early and
addressed promptly. This proactive planning approach contributes to the successful execution of
the Campus Navigation System by keeping the project aligned with its goals, deadlines, and
stakeholder expectations.
Project Phases and Tasks
1. Phase One: Research and Requirements Gathering
This initial phase established the foundation of the Campus Navigation System by focusing on
research, requirements gathering, proposal development, and system design. The tasks in this
phase followed a structured sequence to ensure that the project was based on accurate data and
user needs. The process began with comprehensive research to understand existing campus
navigation solutions and identify gaps in accessibility, usability, and real-time location tracking.
Following this, requirements gathering was carried out to define the system’s functional and nonfunctional needs based on student, staff, and visitor feedback. Proposal development then
formalized the system’s objectives, scope, and implementation strategy. Finally, system design
was undertaken, where the architecture, data flow, and navigation logic were defined. The
successful completion of these tasks led to Milestone 1: Research and System Design Completed,
marking the project’s readiness to move into the development stage.

2. Phase Two: System Implementation

This phase concentrated on building and integrating the core components of the Campus
Navigation System. It began with frontend development, where the user interface and user
experience were created to allow smooth map navigation and intuitive access to building details.
This was followed by backend development, which established the server-side logic, handled
database connections, and supported real-time location queries. Next, API integration was
performed to connect the system with mapping services such as Google Maps API and indoor
positioning tools. Once the core functionalities were in place, deployment was done to host the
system in a live environment, making it accessible for testing and feedback. The completion of
this stage marked Milestone 2: System Implementation Completed, signifying that the Campus
Navigation System was functional and ready for evaluation.
3. Phase Three: Testing, Documentation, and Presentation
The final phase emphasized ensuring system reliability, preparing documentation, and presenting
the project outcomes. It began with software testing and evaluation, where the system was assessed
for accuracy in navigation, performance, and user experience. Any detected bugs or
inconsistencies were fixed to ensure stable operation. Following testing, project documentation
was completed, summarizing all development processes, tools used, challenges encountered, and
how they were addressed. The phase concluded with the final presentation and report submission,
where the system was demonstrated to stakeholders and evaluators. This marked Milestone 3:
Testing, Documentation, and Presentation Completed, confirming that the Campus Navigation
System met its objectives and was ready for deployment within the university environment.
Dependencies
The project followed a logical flow of dependencies that ensured each task was completed before
the next began. For instance, system design could only start after requirements gathering was
finalized. Similarly, backend development depended on the completion of frontend structures,
while API integration required both frontend and backend to be in place. Testing and
documentation were dependent on the successful deployment of the system. These dependencies
ensured a smooth transition between activities, reduced bottlenecks, and maintained consistent
project progress.

CHAPTER 5: SYSTEM ANALYSIS AND DESIGN

5.1 Overview
This chapter presents the system analysis and design of the proposed USIU Campus Navigation
System. It outlines the structural and functional models that define how the system operates,
interacts with users, and achieves its intended objectives. The chapter introduces various diagrams,
including system architecture, use case models, flowcharts, data flow diagrams, class diagrams,
activity diagrams, and sequence diagrams, which collectively illustrate the internal workings of
the system. Additionally, wireframes are provided to showcase the user interface design and
navigation flow, offering a preview of the end-user experience. By integrating both conceptual and
visual representations, this chapter establishes a clear foundation for the implementation phase,
ensuring that the navigation system is both functional and user-friendly.

System Models
System Architecture Diagram

A system architecture diagram is a visual representation that shows how different components of
a system interact and work together. It illustrates the structure, data flow, and relationships between
the user interface, application logic, and data storage layers. In the case of the Campus Navigation
System, the diagram outlines how users, the mobile application, backend server, and external
services like Google Maps connect to deliver location and navigation features efficiently.

6|Page

Figure 12: System Architecture Diagram

Figure 12 above shows the architecture of the Campus Navigation System follows a three-tier
design consisting of the Presentation Layer, Application Layer, and Data Layer. Each layer
performs specific roles that collectively enable the system to function efficiently, ensure
modularity, and support real-time interactions between users and system services.
1. Presentation Layer
This layer represents the user interface and interaction point of the system. It consists of Students,
Staff, Visitors, and Administrators, who access the system through a Mobile Application Frontend.
Students, Staff, and Visitors can search for campus facilities, view maps, and get directions to
classrooms, offices, or other locations within the institution.
The Administrator manages facility data such as building names, locations, and categories,
ensuring the information displayed to users is accurate and up to date.

7|Page

The frontend communicates user requests (such as searching for a location or requesting
directions) to the backend via API calls and receives processed results to display as interactive
maps or location details.
This layer ensures that users interact with an intuitive, responsive, and user-friendly interface,
providing a seamless navigation experience.
2. Application Layer
The Application Layer acts as the intermediary between the user interface and the underlying data
resources. It is primarily powered by a Backend Server / API, which handles business logic, data
processing, and communication between the frontend and database.
•

The backend processes incoming API requests from the mobile application, such as
location searches or facility management updates.

•

It integrates with external services (like Google Maps API) to process geolocation data,
route generation, and map visualization.

•

Once data is processed, the backend sends the results back to the frontend for user display.

This layer ensures real-time functionality, secure data exchange, and smooth coordination between
system components.
3. Data Layer
The Data Layer is responsible for managing and storing all essential information used by the
system. It consists of:
•

A Campus Database, which stores structured information such as building details, facility
locations, user profiles, and navigation data. The backend queries and updates this database
whenever users perform searches or administrators modify facility information.

•

External Services such as Google Maps API and Firebase, which support advanced
mapping, location tracking, authentication, and real-time data synchronization.

This layer ensures that the system operates with reliable data storage, accurate geolocation
services, and secure access control.

Use Case Diagram

A Use Case Diagram is employed to model the interactions between users (actors) and the system,
illustrating the different services the application will provide. For the USIU-A campus navigation
system, the diagram identifies the primary actors and the use cases they are associated with. This
ensures that the system functionalities remain user-centered and aligned with the needs established
in the requirements phase.

Figure 13:Use Case Diagram

Figure 13 above shows the use case diagram and it illustrates the key interactions between users
and the Campus Navigation System. It identifies four primary actors: Student/Visitor, Admin,
System (Automated Functions), and Maintenance Personnel.
The Student/Visitor interacts with the system to search for specific campus locations such as
lecture halls, offices, cafeterias, and hostels. They can also view real-time navigation routes, access
building details, check event or service locations, and receive notifications on temporary closures
or route changes.
9|Page

The Admin is responsible for managing the system database, which includes updating campus
maps, adding or modifying location data, handling user accounts, and monitoring system
performance. The admin also ensures that all navigation information remains accurate and up to
date.
The Maintenance Personnel work closely with the admin to report or update information related
to changes on the campus infrastructure—such as building renovations, new constructions, or
blocked paths—to keep the navigation data reliable and current.
Meanwhile, the System (Automated Functions) performs background tasks such as providing route
suggestions based on the user’s current location, updating map data, sending notifications for map
changes, and generating analytical reports on user activity.
The diagram also demonstrates various relationships such as «include» for shared processes like
user authentication (login/sign-up) and location search, and «extend» for optional or conditional
processes like route recalculation, event notifications, or dynamic updates triggered by real-time
campus changes.
5.1.3

Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)

Introduction
An ERD illustrates the logical structure of the database by showing entities, their attributes, and
the relationships between them. For the USIU Campus Navigation System, the ERD is essential
because the system relies heavily on a database to store and retrieve information about buildings,
facilities, users, and navigation data.
This ensures that the system can quickly return accurate results when students, staff, or visitors
search for a building, request directions, or access facility details.

10 | P a g e

Figure 14: Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)

Figure 14 above shows the Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) for the Campus Navigation
System , it illustrates the key entities within the system and how they relate to each other. It defines
the structure of the database by showing entities such as Users, Facilities, Locations, and
Navigation Routes, along with their attributes and connections.
For instance, a User (which could be a student, staff, or visitor) can search or access multiple
Facilities on campus, while each Facility is linked to a specific Location. The Routes entity helps
store path data between locations to enable navigation and direction features.
This diagram ensures efficient data organization and supports the interaction between the mobile
application and backend database, enabling smooth retrieval, storage, and management of campusrelated information.
5.1.4

Data Flow Diagram (DFD)

A Data Flow Diagram (DFD) is a visual representation of how data moves within a system. It
focuses on the flow of information between processes, data stores, and external entities, showing
how inputs are transformed into outputs through different system functions. Unlike flowcharts that
show the sequence of operations, a DFD emphasizes what data is being transferred and where it
flows, helping to understand the logical structure of a system. It is typically developed in levels—

11 | P a g e

starting from a general overview (Level 0) and moving to more detailed diagrams (Level 1, Level
2, etc.) that break down specific processes.
i.

Level 0: Context Diagram

The Level 0 DFD, also known as the Context Diagram, represents the system as a single process
and shows how it interacts with external entities. It provides a high-level view of data flow without
going into detailed processes.

Figure 15: Level 0 Context Diagram

Figure 15 above shows a level 0 context diagram, users serve as the main external entities who
provide input to the system through location search queries, route requests, or specific building
lookups. For example, a student may search for the quickest route to a lecture hall, or a visitor may
request directions to administrative offices or parking areas. These requests are transmitted to the
Campus Navigation System, which processes the input and returns corresponding navigation
results such as route maps, estimated walking times, or alternative paths in case of restricted areas.
The system also interacts with administrators, who provide data inputs such as updated building
locations, facility information, or notices about inaccessible areas. This ensures that users receive

12 | P a g e

accurate and up-to-date navigation results. The administrator’s role helps maintain the reliability
and accuracy of the data used by the system.
Essentially, the Level 0 DFD focuses on depicting the exchange of data between users and the
system without delving into how each function is executed internally. It shows the overall data
movement, where external users send queries to the Campus Navigation System, and the system,
in turn, outputs relevant route details and location information. This provides a clear and simplified
visualization of the system’s scope, emphasizing the input and output data flows that define the
system’s primary purpose — to help users navigate the university campus easily and efficiently.
ii.

Level 1: Detailed DFD

The Level 1 Data Flow Diagram (DFD) of the Campus Navigation System provides a more
detailed representation of how the system functions internally by decomposing the single process
shown in the Level 0 diagram into several interconnected sub-processes. This breakdown helps in
understanding the logical flow of data within the system and how different components interact to
deliver navigation services to users. Unlike the Level 0 DFD, which only shows external
interactions, the Level 1 diagram dives deeper to explain the internal data transformations and the
relationships between various processes, data stores, and external entities.
In this level, the main system process is divided into smaller, well-defined sub-processes such as
User Authentication, Search Location, Generate Navigation Route, and Update Campus Data.
Each of these processes performs a specific function that contributes to the overall efficiency and
reliability of the Campus Navigation System. For instance, the User Authentication process
ensures that only authorized users, such as students and staff, can access certain system features.
The Search Location process allows users to input queries, such as searching for a particular
classroom or facility, while the Generate Navigation Route process uses that input to determine
the most optimal path within the campus. Meanwhile, Update Campus Data enables administrators
to add or modify information such as new buildings, blocked routes, or event locations.
The diagram also highlights the data stores that support these processes primarily the Campus
Location Database and the User Information Repository. These repositories store essential
information that allows the system to respond accurately and quickly to user requests. Data

13 | P a g e

continuously flows between the users, the system processes, and these storage components,
ensuring up-to-date navigation results and reliable user experiences.

Figure 16: Level 1: Detailed DFD

Figure 16 above shows the Level 1 DFD further that emphasizes how these interconnected
processes collaborate to produce smooth and effective system functionality. It demonstrates the
logical pathways that data follows — for example, when a user searches for a lecture hall, the
system retrieves relevant information from the Campus Location Database, processes it through
the Generate Navigation Route function, and returns detailed directions back to the user interface.
14 | P a g e

Similarly, when administrators update or modify campus data, the new information is stored and
made immediately available to users for subsequent navigation requests.
This level of detail provides valuable insight into how the system’s internal components support
each other to maintain accuracy and real-time responsiveness. It showcases the efficiency of data
flow within the Campus Navigation System, ensuring that the right information is delivered to the
right user at the right time. The Level 1 DFD therefore serves as a bridge between the broad
overview provided in Level 0 and the more granular processes detailed in Level 2, illustrating a
well-structured and logically connected system that facilitates seamless movement and
accessibility across the campus.
iii.

Level 2 : Detailed DFD

The Level 2 Data Flow Diagram for the Campus Navigation System provides a detailed breakdown
of the major processes that were introduced in the Level 1 DFD. While Level 1 focused on the
broader interaction between the user, the system, and the main processes such as “User
Authentication,” “Location Search,” and “Navigation Display,” this Level 2 diagram expands
those processes to show exactly how data moves within each function. It helps visualize how
information is entered, processed, stored, and output in more specific detail.
The Level 2 DFD starts by examining the User Authentication process in depth. When a user logs
in, their credentials are captured by the Input User Data sub-process. The information is then
passed to the Validate Credentials sub-process, which checks it against the User Database. If the
credentials match, the system allows access through the Grant Access sub-process and directs the
user to the home dashboard. If not, an error message is sent back to the user interface for correction.
The next major process is the Search Location function. At this level, it is broken down into smaller
steps such as Receive Search Query, Verify Search Input, Fetch Location Details, and Display
Search Results. When the user types a name—like “Library” or “Administration Block”—the
system first validates whether the name exists in the Location Database. Once verified, the relevant
coordinates and building details are retrieved and displayed on the screen.
Another core process in this level is Generate Route. This part is expanded into Capture Starting
Point, Retrieve Destination Coordinates, Calculate Optimal Path, and Display Navigation Route.
15 | P a g e

The sub-processes show how the system determines the user’s current location, retrieves the
destination’s coordinates from the Map Database, computes the shortest or most convenient route,
and then visually presents it on the app’s interactive map.
The Level 2 DFD also includes background processes like Update Map Information and Manage
Feedback. The update function allows the system administrator to refresh location data or add new
facilities through the Admin Panel, which is linked to the Location Database. The feedback process
collects user input from the Feedback Form, processes it under Store Feedback Data, and saves it
to the Feedback Repository for later analysis or system improvement.
.

16 | P a g e

Figure 17:Level 2 : Detailed DFD

Figure 17 above shows the level 2 DFD diagram.After developing the Level 2 DFD, the data flow
of the entire Campus Navigation System became clearer and more transparent. Each interaction
between the user, databases, and internal processes could now be traced step by step. For instance,
when a student logs in and searches for a lecture hall, the diagram clearly shows how the request
moves through authentication, validation, database retrieval, and finally to map display. This
detailed flow ensures that no critical data movement is overlooked during implementation.
The diagram also highlights how internal components are interlinked. The User Database,
Location Database, and Map Database interact constantly, supporting the smooth exchange of data.
This interconnected structure ensures that users always receive up-to-date navigation details and
accurate building information. Additionally, the flow from Generate Route back to the Display
17 | P a g e

Results process ensures that users can see both their current position and the recommended route
on one screen, improving usability.
After the diagram was completed, it became possible to analyze the efficiency of data handling
within the system. The team could identify potential issues such as duplicated data paths or
unnecessary processes and optimize them before coding. The Level 2 DFD therefore acted as a
problem-prevention tool, reducing the risk of system errors during development. It also helped in
finalizing how the databases would be structured and how the app’s backend logic would interact
with the user interface.
In conclusion, the Level 2 DFD for the Campus Navigation System provides a comprehensive
view of the system’s data movement and logic. It breaks down each main process—user login,
location search, route generation, and feedback management—into clear, traceable sub-processes.
Before the diagram, planning focused on identifying key system activities and their relationships;
after the diagram, these ideas were refined into a working data structure ready for development.
The Level 2 DFD ultimately serves as a bridge between conceptual design and actual
programming, ensuring that every function of the app operates efficiently and consistently.

Flowchart

A flowchart is a visual representation that outlines the step-by-step flow of processes or activities
within a system. It uses standardized symbols such as ovals, rectangles, diamonds, and arrows to
depict actions, decisions, and the direction of process flow. In the context of the Campus
Navigation System, the flowchart provides a clear and logical view of how users interact with the
system from start to finish. It visually demonstrates the sequence of operations — from user login
and input of location queries to the generation of navigation routes and display of results. This
makes it easier to understand the logical order of events, identify decision points, and visualize
how the system responds under different user actions or conditions.

18 | P a g e

Figure 18:Flowchart

Figure 18 shows the flowchart of the Campus Navigation System that illustrates the systematic
process a user follows when using the application. It begins when the user launches the system and
logs in, after which the system verifies the credentials. If the login is successful, the user can
19 | P a g e

proceed to search for a specific location or building within the campus. Once the search query is
entered, the system checks the Campus Location Database for a match. If the location exists, the
system generates and displays the most efficient navigation route. However, if the location is not
found, an error message is shown prompting the user to refine their search.
Additionally, the flowchart demonstrates how administrators and security officers interact with the
system to update or modify campus information. The process ensures that new data is stored and
reflected in real-time for all users. By visually presenting each step, the flowchart helps to clarify
the logical flow of operations, simplifies system understanding, and supports the development and
troubleshooting processes. It effectively captures how different users navigate through the system,
making it a valuable tool for system design, documentation, and future improvements.
5.1.6

Activity Diagram

An activity diagram is a type of behavioral diagram used in system modeling to represent the flow
of activities and actions within a process. It focuses on how different tasks are carried out in
sequence, the decisions made along the way, and how various activities connect to achieve a
specific goal. In the context of the Campus Navigation System, the activity diagram visually
demonstrates the step-by-step workflow from when a user interacts with the system to when they
receive navigation results or updates. It helps illustrate both user-driven and system-driven
processes, such as logging in, searching for locations, generating routes, and updating campus
data. By using decision points, parallel activities, and start/end states, the activity diagram gives a
clear view of the logical flow of operations and how different parts of the system collaborate to
deliver smooth navigation and user support.

20 | P a g e

Figure 19:Activity Diagram

Figure 19 shows the activity diagram for the Campus Navigation System that outlines the logical
sequence of actions that occur when users interact with the platform. The process begins with the
21 | P a g e

user login or registration, after which the system verifies credentials. Once authenticated, the user
can perform actions such as searching for a location, viewing campus routes, or requesting
navigation assistance. The diagram shows how these actions flow from one stage to another — for
instance, after entering a search query, the system retrieves relevant location data, processes it
through the navigation logic, and displays the optimal route.
For administrative users, the activity diagram includes additional actions such as adding or
updating campus locations and managing user data. Decision nodes are used to represent choices,
such as whether the entered location exists in the database or whether an update is required. If
conditions are met, the process continues; otherwise, the system prompts the user to try again or
provides alternative options.
Overall, the activity diagram provides a detailed visualization of how the Campus Navigation
System handles both normal and exceptional scenarios. It emphasizes the smooth flow of data and
decisions from start to finish, ensuring efficient user interactions and accurate delivery of
navigation information across different user roles within the system.
5.1.7

Sequence diagram

A sequence diagram is a type of interaction diagram used in system design to show how objects
and components interact with each other over time. It focuses on the order of messages exchanged
between different entities in a system to accomplish a specific function or process. Sequence
diagrams are particularly useful in visualizing dynamic behaviors such as user actions, system
responses, and data exchanges. In the Campus Navigation System, the sequence diagram
demonstrates how users — including students, visitors, and administrators — interact with the
system to perform tasks like searching for locations, generating navigation routes, and updating
campus data. It helps designers and developers understand the timing and flow of operations,
ensuring that each process occurs in a logical and efficient order.

22 | P a g e

Figure 20: Sequence diagram

Figure 20 shows the sequence diagram for the Campus Navigation System that illustrates the stepby-step flow of interactions between key components, including the User, System Interface,
Navigation Controller, Database, and Admin. The process begins when a User initiates an action
such as searching for a specific campus location or requesting navigation assistance. The System
Interface captures this request and forwards it to the Navigation Controller, which handles the main
logic of the operation. The Navigation Controller then interacts with the Database to retrieve
relevant data for example, location details, building coordinates, or stored routes.
Once the data is retrieved, the Navigation Controller processes the information and generates the
required navigation route, which is then sent back through the System Interface for display to the
User. For administrative tasks, the Admin actor may initiate operations like adding new locations
or updating existing campus details, which follow a similar interaction pattern involving data
verification and database updates.
Overall, the sequence diagram captures the real-time interaction between users and the system,
clearly showing how requests flow through various components to produce accurate and timely

23 | P a g e

responses. It ensures that every function — from user login to navigation route generation — is
executed in the correct sequence, promoting system reliability and user satisfaction.
5.1.8

Class diagram

A class diagram is a type of structural diagram in system design that illustrates the blueprint of an
object-oriented system by showing the system’s classes, their attributes, methods, and the
relationships among them. It provides a static view of the system, helping developers understand
how different components interact and depend on one another. In the Campus Navigation System,
the class diagram serves as the foundation for understanding how data and functionality are
organized within the system. It helps in identifying key entities such as users, locations, routes,
and administrators, along with their specific roles and interactions. This visualization ensures that
the system’s architecture is well-structured, supports reusability, and maintains clear relationships
between the different parts of the system.

24 | P a g e

Figure 21: Class diagram

Figure 21 shows the class diagram for the Campus Navigation System that depicts the main classes
and their interconnections that support the system’s functionality. Key classes include User,
Admin, Location, Route, and NavigationSystem. The User class represents all users of the system,
such as students and visitors, and includes attributes like user ID, name, and login credentials. The
Admin class extends the User class, adding additional responsibilities like updating campus data,
managing locations, and overseeing the system’s operation.
The Location class stores information about various campus places such as lecture halls, offices,
and facilities, while the Route class manages navigation details, including start and end points and
25 | P a g e

the path generated between them. The NavigationSystem class serves as the central component
that coordinates user requests, retrieves data from the Location and Route classes, and provides
users with accurate navigation instructions. Relationships such as associations and dependencies
are clearly shown — for example, a User interacts with the NavigationSystem to search for a
location, and the system, in turn, communicates with the Route class to generate a navigation path.
Overall, the class diagram illustrates how different entities within the Campus Navigation System
work together to support efficient campus guidance, data management, and user interaction,
forming the backbone of the system’s design and implementation.
5.1.9

Wireframe

The wireframes for the Campus Navigation System serve as the main blueprint of the entire mobile
app. They outline how each screen will look, what components will appear, and how users will
move from one function to another. At this stage, the focus is not on colors or decoration but on
structure and functionality. The wireframes help to ensure that features like search, navigation,
location markers, and campus details are well-organized before actual coding begins.
Wireframing played a key role in transforming the idea of the app into a structured plan. Since the
app aims to help students, staff, and visitors find their way around campus, it was important to
visualize how users would move between pages like the login page, home screen, search bar, and
map interface. The wireframes make it easy to see how each of these sections will connect and
how users can quickly locate buildings, departments, or routes.
Before creating the diagrams, the main user journeys were mapped out in simple lists and
flowcharts. For example, a user might open the app, sign in, tap the search bar, type the name of a
lecture hall, and then view the route to reach it. These steps helped identify what pages were
necessary and what elements needed to be included on each screen.
The initial wireframes were low-fidelity, meaning they were drawn using simple boxes, circles,
and labels. These rough sketches helped to decide where to place major elements like navigation
menus, icons, and buttons. For instance, the top of the screen might include a search field, the
center area might display the interactive map, and the bottom part might hold shortcut buttons for
quick access to key features. This stage helped create a clear structure that both designers and
developers could understand.
26 | P a g e

Figure 22:Wireframe

Figure 22 above represents the wireframe for the campus navigation system. The first page of the
USIU Campus Navigation System wireframe focuses on the maps and search functionality, which
serves as the central point of interaction for users. A prominently placed search bar allows students,
staff, and visitors to type in the name of a building, department, or facility, with an auto-complete
feature that suggests relevant locations as they type, thereby improving efficiency and reducing
search time. The main area of the page is dedicated to an interactive digital map of the USIUAfrica campus, which allows zooming, panning, and selection of specific locations. When a user
selects a facility, a pin marker appears on the map along with a pop-up card displaying details such
as the name, function, and distance from the user’s current location. Integration of GPS-based realtime tracking enables users to see their live position and follow a visual route toward their
destination.
Additional features on this page include filters and layer controls that allow users to toggle between
different categories of locations, such as academic buildings, libraries, cafeterias, or hostels. This
design choice ensures that users can customize the map view according to their specific needs,
making the system more versatile and user-centered. The interface emphasizes clarity and
simplicity, ensuring that even first-time visitors can navigate the campus effectively while reducing
cognitive load through intuitive design elements. Overall, this page establishes the foundation for
27 | P a g e

a seamless navigation experience by combining interactive mapping, real-time location tracking,
and user-friendly search functionality.
The second page presents different school facilities in a structured and organized layout. Facilities
are grouped into categories such as academic buildings, administrative offices, student services,
and recreational areas. Each facility is represented by a clickable icon or card that provides key
information, including the facility name, purpose, and any operational details. This page enhances
user exploration by allowing students and visitors to browse the campus visually rather than
relying solely on search queries. Quick-access tabs or filters enable users to narrow down facilities
by category, which improves usability and reduces the time needed to locate a desired destination.
The design also emphasizes consistency in visual elements and labeling to ensure that users can
quickly recognize different types of facilities at a glance.
The third page focuses on favorited facilities, offering users the ability to save frequently visited
or important locations for quick access. Each favorited facility is displayed in a list or grid format
with key details, such as distance from the user and a shortcut to navigation. Users can manage
their favorites by adding or removing facilities, creating a personalized and efficient navigation
experience. This feature supports daily campus routines and enhances convenience, especially for
students who regularly move between lecture halls, libraries, and other frequently used spaces.
Visual indicators, such as star icons or bookmarks, make the interface intuitive and allow users to
identify their saved locations at a glance.
The fourth page is dedicated to emergency contacts, providing quick access to critical services
such as campus security, medical assistance, and administrative support. Contact information is
displayed prominently along with icons that represent each service, and a one-touch call or
message feature is integrated to allow immediate communication in urgent situations. The design
prioritizes accessibility, ensuring that users can locate emergency contacts quickly without
navigating through multiple menus. Color coding, consistent iconography, and clear labeling
enhance visibility and reduce response time during emergencies. This page emphasizes safety and
preparedness, reinforcing the system’s role as not only a navigation tool but also a resource for
campus security and student wellbeing.

The system should support an increasing number of users, buildings, and routes as the
campus grows. The database should be expandable to accommodate future updates (e.g.,
new departments, hostels, or facilities).

CHAPTER 6: IMPLEMENTATION
Introduction

The implementation phase of the USIU Campus Navigator mobile application represented the
crucial transformation of theoretical design specifications and comprehensive requirements
documentation into a fully operational, production-ready Android application. This extensive
development stage encompassed the systematic creation of multiple interconnected modules,
seamless system integration across various Android components, and rigorous testing on multiple
device configurations. The primary objective was to deliver a robust, intuitive, and featurecomplete navigation solution that would serve the diverse needs of United States International
University Africa's academic community.
The implementation prioritized creating an accessible platform where students, faculty, staff, and
campus visitors could efficiently navigate the extensive USIU campus facilities, locate specific
buildings and services with precision, access critical emergency contact information instantly, and
personalize their experience through persistent favorites management. Special emphasis was
placed on developing a responsive user interface that maintains consistency across various device
sizes and orientations while adhering to modern Material Design principles and USIU's official
branding guidelines.
The comprehensive feature set includes advanced Google Maps integration with campus-boundary
restrictions, real-time GPS location tracking with accuracy indicators, intelligent facility status
systems that dynamically reflect operational hours, and secure local data persistence for user
preferences. The application architecture was meticulously designed to serve as an indispensable
daily tool for both newcomers orienting themselves to the campus layout and long-term
community members seeking optimized navigation between frequently visited locations, thereby
significantly enhancing overall campus accessibility and user experience.
6.2

Frontend Implementation

The frontend architecture of the USIU Campus Navigator was constructed using Java
programming language within the Android native development framework, leveraging the full
capabilities of the Android SDK to deliver a polished, responsive, and highly intuitive user
interface. The application systematically implements Material Design 3 components throughout
33 | P a g e

all interface elements to ensure visual consistency, accessibility compliance, and professional
aesthetics that align with modern mobile application standards. The carefully structured interface
facilitates effortless navigation through four logically organized main sections via a persistent
bottom navigation bar, enabling seamless transitions between real-time interactive mapping,
comprehensive facility exploration, personalized favorites management, and critical emergency
contact access.
The design philosophy consistently emphasizes usability while maintaining strict adherence to
USIU's official brand identity, incorporating the university's signature color palette of dark blue
(#002147) and accent gold (#CFB991) throughout all visual elements. This strategic
implementation ensures a cohesive and institutionally aligned user experience across all device
configurations, from compact mobile phones to larger tablet displays, while maintaining optimal
performance and responsiveness.
i. Main Application Structure and Navigation Implementation
The Map Interface serves as the foundational component of the USIU Campus Navigator, acting as the
primary entry point for users seeking spatial orientation. Implemented within the MapFragment class, this
interface leverages the Google Maps SDK for Android to render a high-fidelity, vector-based map of the
campus. The fragment implements the OnMapReadyCallback interface, ensuring that all map-related logic,
such as setting camera angles and enabling location layers, is executed asynchronously only after the
Google Play Services have fully rendered the map tiles. This approach prevents the main UI thread from
hanging during initialization, resulting in a stutter-free user experience.
To ensure the application remains focused on its primary objective, campus navigation, a strict Camera
Boundary Restriction was implemented. Without this constraint, users could accidentally scroll away from
the campus into surrounding neighborhoods like Roysambu or Garden Estate, losing their orientation. The
implementation defines a specific LatLngBounds object corresponding to the geographical corners of the
USIU Africa campus. The camera logic is programmed to reject any scroll or pan gestures that would move
the viewport outside these defined coordinates, effectively "locking" the user's view to the relevant
educational environment.
A significant portion of the implementation logic is dedicated to Real-Time Facility Status. To solve the
problem of students walking to closed facilities, the MapFragment initializes a status tracker upon creation.
This logic utilizes the Java Calendar instance to retrieve the current day of the week and hour of the day. It
then applies conditional logic—specific to USIU operations—to determine if facility types like "Office,"

34 | P a g e

"Restaurant," or "Pool" are currently open. For example, the logic dictates that the pool is only open on
weekdays between 7 AM and 5 PM, while academic buildings remain accessible for longer durations.
The interface also integrates Quick Access Navigation through card interaction listeners. Instead of
requiring users to manually pinch and zoom to find popular locations, the implementation attaches
OnClickListener events to specific UI cards (Library, Sports, Cafeteria). When a user taps a card, the
application programmatically triggers a CameraUpdateFactory.newLatLngZoom command. This smoothly
animates the camera to the precise latitude and longitude of the selected facility, adjusting the zoom level
to 17.0f to provide an optimal view of the building's footprint.
Finally, the MapFragment handles the critical Runtime Permission Logic required for the "My Location"
layer. Before enabling the blue dot that represents the user's GPS position, the code checks if
ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION has been granted by the user. If the permission is missing, the app requests
it via ActivityCompat; if granted, the mMap.setMyLocationEnabled(true) method is called. This ensures
the app complies with Android's privacy standards while providing the essential wayfinding feature that
allows students to see their position relative to campus landmarks.

Figure 23: MapFragment Class Declaration and Geographical Constants

35 | P a g e

Figure 23 above illustrates the foundational setup of the map interface within the MapFragment
class. The code snippet highlights the declaration of essential class-level variables, including the
GoogleMap object and the FusedLocationProviderClient for GPS tracking. Additionally, it shows
the definition of the static USIU_BOUNDS constant, which establishes the strict geographical
coordinates used to restrict the camera view to the campus area, ensuring users remain focused on
the relevant environment..
Lines 30–32: Declares essential class-level variables. mMap holds the reference to the visual map,
while fusedLocationClient is the entry point for the Google Play Services location APIs, used to
retrieve the device's precise GPS coordinates.
Lines 35–38: Defines USIU_BOUNDS as a static constant using the LatLngBounds class. This
block hardcodes the specific Southwest and Northeast geographical coordinates of the USIU
campus, creating the mathematical rectangle used to constrain the user's view.
Line 41: Initializes the declaration for facilityStatus. This Map<String, String> data structure is
designed to store the real-time operational state (e.g., "Open" or "Closed") of various campus
facilities, decoupling the data storage from the UI logic.

36 | P a g e

Figure 24: Fragment Initialization and Real-Time Status Logic

Figure 24 above illustrates the initialization logic executed when the map fragment is created. The
code within the onCreateView method demonstrates how the application prepares the user
interface by inflating the layout and calling helper methods to set up the facility status tracking.
This section is critical for integrating the backend logic with the visual map component, ensuring
that features like the search bar and smart status indicators are ready for user interaction
immediately upon launch.
Lines 48–62: The onCreateView method orchestrates the fragment's startup. Rather than cluttering
the main lifecycle method, it delegates tasks to helper methods: initializeFacilityStatus() prepares
the data, initializeMap() loads the visual component, and setupButtonListeners() attaches click
events to the UI.
Lines 67–71: The initializeFacilityStatus method begins the real-time logic. It creates a
Java.util.Calendar instance to capture the current system time (Day of Week and Hour of Day),
which is the foundation for deciding if a facility is currently open.
37 | P a g e

Lines 74–75: Implements the specific business logic for administrative offices. It evaluates a
boolean expression checking if the current day is between Monday and Friday
(Calendar.MONDAY to Calendar.FRIDAY) and if the current time is within standard working
hours (08:00 to 17:00).

Figure 25: Asynchronous Map Setup and Runtime Permission Handling.

Figure 25 illustrates the initialization process within the MapFragment class, specifically focusing
on the onMapReady callback and the runtime permission handling logic. This method serves as
the entry point for all map-related operations, ensuring that the Google Map object is fully loaded
before any interactions occur. Additionally, the code demonstrates a critical security check where
the application verifies if the user has granted the ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION permission; if the
permission is missing, the system gracefully handles the scenario by pausing GPS-dependent
features to prevent runtime crashes
38 | P a g e

Lines 134–136: The onMapReady callback is triggered asynchronously once the Google Maps
service is fully loaded. It initializes the global mMap variable, allowing the rest of the class to
interact with the map interface.
Lines 141–148: Implements critical Android security logic. Before accessing the GPS, the code
uses checkSelfPermission to verify if ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION has been granted. If the
permission is missing, it pauses execution to request it from the user via requestPermissions,
preventing the app from crashing due to security violations.
Lines 157–160: The setupMapRestrictions method acts as a "digital fence." It applies
setLatLngBoundsForCameraTarget(USIU_BOUNDS) to strictly limit the scrollable area to the
campus. It also sets a MinZoomPreference of 15.0f, which prevents users from zooming out too
far and losing context of the campus details.

Figure 26: Map Interface showing the Google Map

39 | P a g e

Figure 26 above illustrates a screenshot of the Map Interface showing the Google Map, the Search
Bar at the top, and the Quick Access Cards (Library, Sports, Cafeteria) at the bottom
The Map Interface is designed as the primary navigation hub, prioritizing immediate spatial
orientation and ease of access through a layered UI approach. Dominating the screen is the central
map canvas, which renders high-fidelity vector tiles of the USIU campus. This dynamic layer
supports standard gesture interactions, allowing users to pinch-to-zoom for granular views of
building footprints or rotate the camera to align with their physical orientation. The visual style is
customized to highlight campus footpaths and structures in high contrast, while the user’s realtime position is tracked via a pulsating blue dot with a directional cone, providing immediate
context regarding their location relative to their surroundings.
Situated at the top of the interface is a floating Search Bar, designed with rounded corners and
elevation consistent with Material Design 3 card standards. This widget acts as the primary entry
point for specific queries; tapping it expands the view to allow text input for building names or
facility categories. To the right of the search field, a filter icon provides users with the ability to
toggle the visibility of specific marker types, such as "Academic" or "Dining," effectively reducing
visual clutter on the map and allowing for a more focused navigation experience.
Anchored at the bottom of the screen is a horizontal "Quick Access" carousel, implemented as a
scrollable list of cards overlaying the map view. Each card displays a high-quality thumbnail and
the name of a major facility, such as the Library or Sports Complex. This feature addresses the
common user challenge of not knowing exactly what to search for upon first launch. Tapping any
card in this carousel triggers a programmatic camera update, smoothly flying the viewport to the
selected location. Just above this carousel sits the "My Location" Floating Action Button (FAB),
which allows users to instantly re-center the map on their GPS coordinates if they have panned
away to explore other areas of the campus.
ii. Facilities Directory Implementation
The Facilities Directory serves as the central information hub of the application, providing users
with a comprehensive, searchable list of all key locations within the USIU campus. Unlike the
Map Interface, which offers spatial context, the Directory is optimized for quick data retrieval and
status checking. Implemented within the FacilitiesFragment, this module utilizes a RecyclerView
40 | P a g e

component to render a scrollable, high-performance list of facility objects. The architecture
separates the data layer from the presentation layer using a custom FacilitiesAdapter, which binds
raw data, such as building names, categories, and operating hours to the visual layout defined in
the XML card files. This separation of concerns ensures that the list can scale efficiently to
accommodate hundreds of entries without causing UI lag or memory leaks.
A core innovation within this module is the "Smart Status" logic, designed to address the common
frustration of students walking to closed facilities. The adapter does not simply display static
operating hours; instead, it performs a real-time calculation every time a card is bound to the view.
By capturing the device’s current system time and comparing it against the specific operating
window of each facility type (e.g., Academic, Dining, or Administration), the system dynamically
assigns a status of "Open" or "Closed." This status is visually reinforced through color-coded
indicators Gold for open and Red for closed allowing users to assess availability at a glance while
scrolling, significantly enhancing the utility of the directory.
To further improve usability, the Facilities Directory incorporates a robust search and filtering
mechanism. A SearchView widget located at the top of the interface allows users to filter the list
in real-time by typing keywords, such as "Library" or "Cafeteria." The implementation logic uses
a filtering algorithm within the adapter to instantly update the data set, removing irrelevant items
without reloading the entire fragment. This responsiveness is crucial for new students who may
know the name of a building but not its category or location. Additionally, tapping on any facility
card triggers a navigation intent, linking the directory directly back to the Map Interface to show
the selected location.

41 | P a g e

Figure 27 : Facilities directory implementation

Figure 27 presents the visual logic used to implement the "Smart Status" indicators within the
directory list. The code snippet details the conditional statements that determine the color and text
of the status pill based on the facility's real-time availability. If the getStatus() method returns
"Open," the text is rendered in usiu_status_open (Gold); otherwise, it shifts to usiu_warning_red
(Red). This immediate visual feedback mechanism is essential for allowing users to quickly assess
facility accessibility while scrolling through the directory.
Lines 48-50: The onBindViewHolder method is the core logic block for the list. It retrieves the
Facility object corresponding to the current scroll position from the facilityList.
Lines 56-61: Implements the visual logic for the status indicator. If the facility status matches
"Open", the text color is set to usiu_status_open (Yellow) with a transparent background.
Conversely, if closed, the text color shifts to usiu_warning_red (Red), providing immediate visual
feedback to the user.

42 | P a g e

Figure 28 : Facilities directory implementation

Figure 28 showcases the implementation of interactive action buttons within the facility card,
specifically the "Favorite" and "Directions" features. The code demonstrates how the application
manages user preferences by checking the local SharedPreferences via the isFacilityFavorite
helper method; if a facility is bookmarked, the heart icon's state is updated to reflect this status
visually. Furthermore, the snippet reveals the intent logic attached to the "Directions" button,
which constructs a specific Uri to launch external navigation apps, seamlessly integrating the
campus directory with broader mapping services.
Lines 64-67: Checks the local persistence layer (SharedPreferences) via the helper method
isFacilityFavorite. If the facility is saved as a favorite, the heart icon button color changes to red
and the background drawable is updated to button_pill_active, indicating the active state.
Lines 93-98: Sets up the "Directions" button listener. This code constructs a Uri with the
navigation query for USIU Africa and launches an Intent specifically targeting the Google Maps
application (com.google.android.apps.maps), allowing the user to get turn-by-turn navigation.

43 | P a g e

Figure 29:Facilities Directory UI

Figure 29 above demonstrates the facilities directory UI. Below the primary text information, each
card features a row of interactive action buttons. The Favorite button allows users to toggle the
saved state of the facility, providing a personalized experience. The Directions button triggers an
external map intent, while the Call button connects directly to the facility's office extension.
Finally, a Details button is available to expand a bottom sheet containing comprehensive
information, such as the full description and operating history.

44 | P a g e

Figure 30: Facilities Directory UI

Figure 30 above illustrates a screenshot of the Facilities Directory showing the list of cards with
the Yellow/Red status text and the action buttons.
The Facilities Directory UI is designed as a vertical, scrollable list of information cards. Each card
serves as a compact summary of a specific campus location, displaying the Facility Name
(tvFacilityName) and Category (tvCategory) in bold, legible typography. The status of the building
is prominently displayed on the right side of the card; as detailed in the code, this text appears in
Yellow when the facility is open and Red when closed, allowing users to scan the list rapidly for
available services without opening detailed views.
This layout maximizes functionality while maintaining a clean, uncluttered aesthetic consistent
with USIU branding.
iii. Profile and Support UI
The Profile and Support UI is a critical component designed to serve as the application’s safety
and communication hub. While the Map and Directory fragments focus on exploration, the Profile
45 | P a g e

fragment is engineered for immediate access to institutional support services. Implemented within
the ProfileFragment class, this interface aggregates essential contact points—such as Campus
Security, Health Services, and the Main Office—into a clean, accessible layout. The logic behind
this fragment prioritizes speed and reliability; rather than navigating through complex menus, users
are presented with direct-action cards that trigger native system functions immediately upon
interaction.
Technically, this module relies heavily on Android's Implicit Intents system to bridge the gap
between the application and the device's core telephony and messaging capabilities. The
implementation handles OnClickListener events for various UI cards, programmatically
constructing Intent objects with specific actions like ACTION_DIAL for phone calls and
ACTION_SENDTO for emails. This approach ensures that the application does not need to
reinvent communication tools but instead leverages the user's preferred dialer and email clients,
ensuring a familiar and reliable user experience.
Additionally, the Profile fragment serves as a secondary navigation anchor. It includes logic to
communicate back to the central MainActivity, allowing users to jump directly from the contact
screen back to the map view if they need to locate the office they just contacted. Error handling is
also integrated into the communication logic; specifically for email intents, the code wraps the
start activity call in a try-catch block. This defensive programming ensures that the app remains
stable and provides helpful feedback (via Toasts) even if the user's device lacks a configured email
client.

46 | P a g e

Figure 31 : Implementation of Direct Dial Intents and Internal Navigation Logic.

Figure 31 illustrates the implementation of Android Implicit Intents within the ProfileFragment to
facilitate direct communication features. The code snippet focuses on the setupClickListeners
method, where specific ACTION_DIAL intents are attached to contact cards like "Campus
Security." By parsing the telephone number into a URI, the application can hand off the dialing
process to the system's native phone app. This implementation is crucial for the "Emergency
Contacts" feature, providing users with a reliable, one-tap solution for urgent situations without
requiring manual number entry.
Lines 30–36: The setupClickListeners method initializes the user interaction logic. Specifically,
lines 32–36 attach an OnClickListener to the Security card. When tapped, it creates an Implicit
Intent with the ACTION_DIAL action. By parsing the telephone string (tel:+254...), the app hands
off the operation to the Android system's default dialer, pre-filling the emergency number without
requiring the user to type it.

47 | P a g e

Lines 53–57: This block handles internal app navigation rather than external intents. When the
"Open Map" button is clicked, the code checks if the hosting activity is an instance of
MainActivity. If true, it casts the activity context and calls the public method MapsToMap(). This
allows the Fragment to communicate upward to the Activity to switch tabs or fragments
programmatically.

Figure 32 : Configuration of Email Intent with Runtime Exception Handling.

Figure 32 demonstrates the configuration of the ACTION_SENDTO intent used for the "Email
Us" feature. The code shows how the application constructs a highly specific intent using the
mailto: scheme, ensuring that only email clients (like Gmail or Outlook) respond to the user's
action, filtering out irrelevant apps like SMS. Additionally, the snippet highlights the use of
Intent.EXTRA_SUBJECT to pre-fill the email subject line, streamlining the inquiry process for
students. A critical try-catch block wraps this logic, providing robust error handling that alerts the
user if no email client is found, thereby preventing application crashes.
Lines 61–63: This section configures the Email button using a highly specific intent action:
ACTION_SENDTO. Unlike a generic "share" intent, ACTION_SENDTO combined with the
mailto: URI scheme ensures that the Android system only presents email clients (like Gmail or
Outlook) to the user, filtering out unrelated apps like SMS or social media.
48 | P a g e

Line 64: The implementation enhances user convenience by adding Intent.EXTRA_SUBJECT.
This pre-fills the subject line of the email draft with "USIU Campus Navigator Inquiry," ensuring
that inquiries sent by students are immediately recognizable by the recipient.
Lines 65–69: Critical error handling is implemented here using a try-catch block. If the user's
device does not have an email client installed, the startActivity(intent) call would normally crash
the application. This logic catches that specific exception and instead displays a Toast message
("No email app found"), ensuring a stable user experience.

Figure 33: The Profile and Support UI

49 | P a g e

Figure 33 above illustrates the Profile and Support UI is visually structured to separate general
information from critical emergency services. The top section features the USIU institutional
branding and a "Quick Actions" area. Dominating the center of the screen are high-contrast contact
cards. The Campus Security card is often styled with a distinct icon or color (such as Red or USIU
Blue) to visually differentiate it from standard administrative contacts like the Main Office. This
visual hierarchy ensures that in high-stress situations, users can instinctively identify the correct
button to press.
Below the emergency section, the interface provides secondary support options. The Email Us
button allows for non-urgent administrative inquiries, utilizing the user's default email app for a
seamless transition. Additionally, an Open Map button is strategically placed to allow users to
quickly pivot from viewing contact information to finding the physical location of the offices on
the map. The layout is padded and spaced according to Material Design standards to prevent
accidental clicks, ensuring a reliable and frustration-free user experience.
6.3

Backend Implementation

The backend architecture of the USIU Campus Navigator is designed as a "local-first" system,
ensuring that the application remains fully functional without an active internet connection. Unlike
traditional client-server models that rely on remote APIs and cloud databases, this project utilizes
a robust internal logic layer to manage data persistence, facility status calculations, and user
preferences directly on the device. This approach significantly reduces latency, eliminates data
costs for the user, and ensures that critical navigation information is always available, regardless
of network coverage on campus.
The core of the backend implementation relies on Android’s SharedPreferences framework
combined with the Gson library for object serialization. SharedPreferences provides a lightweight,
key-value storage mechanism ideal for saving primitive data types. To handle complex data
structures, specifically the list of Facility objects that users mark as "Favorites,"the system
implements a serialization layer. This layer converts Java objects into JSON strings for storage and
deserializes them back into objects for runtime use, effectively creating a local NoSQL-like
database within the application's private storage sandbox.

50 | P a g e

Furthermore, the backend logic encapsulates the "Smart Status" algorithms and navigational
intents. Rather than fetching operating hours from a server, the application calculates the
Open/Closed status of facilities in real-time using the device’s system clock and a set of predefined
business rules. This logic is tightly integrated into the data adapters, ensuring that the visual
interface reflects the current reality of the campus services instantly. This section details the
specific implementation of these data persistence mechanisms and logical operations.
i. Data Persistence Implementation (SharedPreferences & Gson)
The Data Persistence module is responsible for retaining user preferences across app sessions.
Implemented primarily within the FacilitiesAdapter class, this logic handles the "Favorites"
feature. When a user taps the heart icon on a facility card, the system does not merely update the
UI; it triggers a transaction that updates a locally stored list. This list is managed using the Google
Gson library, which acts as a bridge between the application's memory (Java Objects) and the
persistent storage (JSON Strings).
The implementation ensures data integrity by checking for existing records before adding new
ones, preventing duplicates. It also handles the retrieval process safely; when the app launches, it
attempts to read the stored JSON string. If the string is null (indicating a fresh install), it gracefully
initializes an empty list, preventing NullPointerExceptions. This robust handling ensures that the
user's curated list of important locations—such as their specific lecture halls or the cafeteria—is
preserved even if the phone is restarted or the app is closed.
The code below illustrates the specific methods used to load and save this data. The loadFavorites()
method retrieves the JSON string from SharedPreferences and converts it into a List<Facility>
using Gson's from Json method. Conversely, the saveFavorites() method performs the reverse
operation, converting the list into a JSON string using toJson and committing it to storage
asynchronously via the apply() method to prevent blocking the main UI thread.

51 | P a g e

Figure 34 : Implementation of the RecyclerView Adapter and View Holder Binding Logic.

Figure 34 depicts the FacilitiesAdapter implementation, which acts as the bridge between the local
data source and the user interface. The onBindViewHolder method is highlighted as the core logic
block responsible for populating each card in the RecyclerView list with dynamic data. It retrieves
facility details based on the current scroll position and updates the UI elements, such as setting the
building name and category, ensuring that the list remains responsive and accurate even when
handling a large dataset of campus locations.
Lines 31–37: The constructor for the FacilitiesAdapter initializes the class. Crucially, it creates a
new Gson instance and immediately calls loadFavorites(). This ensures that the user's saved
preferences are retrieved from storage the moment the list is created, preventing any delay in
showing the correct "favorite" status.
Lines 41–45: The onCreateViewHolder method handles the visual creation of list items. It uses
the LayoutInflater to parse the item_facility.xml layout file. The parameter attachToRoot: false is
specific and necessary for RecyclerViews, as the view checks its own dimensions before being
added to the parent layout.
Lines 48–53: This block represents the onBindViewHolder method, which connects data to the
UI. For every item in the list, it retrieves the specific Facility object and programmatically sets the
text for the name, category, and description TextViews, effectively recycling the layout for multiple
data entries.

52 | P a g e

Figure 35 : JSON Serialization and Persistence Logic using Gson and SharedPreferences.

Figure 35 explains the JSON serialization and persistence logic used for the Favorites feature. The
code snippet focuses on the removeFavorites and loadFavorites methods within the adapter. It
demonstrates how the application utilizes functional programming (specifically the removeIf
lambda expression) to efficiently manage the list state and how the Gson library is employed to
deserialize JSON strings from SharedPreferences back into usable Facility objects, ensuring
seamless data retrieval across sessions.
Lines 132–134: The removeFavorites method utilizes Java 8 functional programming. The
removeIf function uses a lambda expression to iterate through the list and identify the specific
facility by name. Once found and removed, it immediately triggers saveFavorites() to ensure the
local storage is updated.
Lines 137–142: This method handles Data Deserialization. It retrieves a raw JSON string from
SharedPreferences. If data exists, it uses Gson with a TypeToken to convert that string back into a

53 | P a g e

complex ArrayList<Facility> object. The TypeToken is essential here to preserve the list's data
type during conversion.
Lines 147–150: This method handles Data Serialization. It converts the list of objects into a single
JSON string using gson.toJson. It then accesses the SharedPreferences editor and calls .apply() to
write the data to the device's storage asynchronously, ensuring the UI thread is not blocked during
the save operation.

Figure 36: "Favorites" UI

54 | P a g e

Figure 36 above illustrates that the "Favorites" UI serves as the visual confirmation of the backend
persistence logic. When a user successfully toggles the heart icon in the directory, the facility is
added to the internal list and saved. This screen, implemented in FavoritesFragment, retrieves the
persisted list and displays it. If the list is empty, a placeholder text ("No Favorites Yet") is shown.
This interface allows users to quickly access their most-visited locations without searching through
the full directory, demonstrating the practical utility of the local data storage implementation.
6.4 Integration
The integration phase of the USIU Campus Navigator aimed at establishing seamless connectivity
between the various Android components—Activities, Fragments, and the local Data Manager.
The objective was to ensure smooth navigation flows and instant data synchronization across the
user interface, allowing students and faculty to switch between the Map, Facilities Directory, and
Profile screens without losing state or experiencing lag. This phase was crucial in validating key
system workflows such as dynamic marker placement, smart status updates, and external
communication via system intents. Through consistent testing and configuration, the system
achieved an efficient, interactive, and reliable native user experience.
Essential Integration Tasks:
1. Fragment and Activity Integration Integrated the MapFragment, FacilitiesFragment, and
ProfileFragment within the central MainActivity using the Android Navigation component. This
connection ensured that the bottom navigation bar acted as a persistent controller, allowing users
to switch contexts instantly. Unlike web pages that reload, this integration utilized Fragment
transactions (hide/show) to preserve the map’s zoom level and the directory’s scroll position when
switching tabs.

55 | P a g e

Figure 37: Fragment Transaction and Navigation Logic

Figure 37 illustrates the integration of the main navigation controller within the MainActivity
class. The code snippet demonstrates how the application manages the user's journey between the
Map, Facilities, Favorites, and Profile screens without launching new activities. It utilizes a
BottomNavigationView listener to detect user input and triggers the corresponding fragment
replacement, ensuring that the application remains a lightweight, single-activity container while
providing a seamless, tab-based user experience.
Lines 37: Initializes the BottomNavigationView by finding the view ID defined in the layout
XML. This establishes the link between the backend logic and the visible navigation bar.
Lines 39-58: Implements the setOnItemSelectedListener. This critical block listens for user taps
on the bottom bar icons. An if-else structure checks the unique ID of the clicked item (e.g.,
56 | P a g e

R.id.navigation_map) and instantiates the corresponding Fragment class. This logic acts as the
central router for the application.
Lines 53-55: Checks if a valid fragment was selected and calls the helper method loadFragment().
This ensures that the UI only updates if a valid navigation target is identified, preventing potential
null pointer exceptions.

Figure 38: Main Navigation Interface

Figure 38 above shows the primary user interface for the USIU Campus Navigator, highlighting
the persistent bottom navigation bar. This component serves as the central navigation hub, allowing
users to switch contexts seamlessly between the Map, Facilities, Favorites, and Profile screens
without losing their current state. The active tab is visually distinguished by the USIU Gold accent
color, providing immediate feedback on the user's location within the application hierarchy,
57 | P a g e

confirming that the underlying fragment transaction logic is correctly updating the UI state in
response to user input.

2. Map and Local Data Integration Connected the GoogleMap instance in the MapFragment
directly to the DataManager class. Instead of hardcoding markers, the system iterates through the
centralized list of Facility objects to dynamically populate the map. This ensures that if a facility's
details (like name or coordinates) are updated in the data model, the visual marker on the map
reflects this change immediately upon the next app launch.

Figure 39:Map Initialization and Local Data Binding

Figure 39 illustrates how the MapFragment links the GoogleMap instance to the app’s local facility
data. The snippet shows how the fragment captures the map object, enables tapping on points of
interest, locks the camera inside the USIU bounds with zoom limits, and ties the search input to
58 | P a g e

the CampusData list so the map can move to any stored facility and show its details without
opening a new activity.
Lines 74–78: Initializes the GoogleMap object and sets the POI click listener.
These lines store the GoogleMap reference in mMap and register this as the OnPoiClickListener.
This lets the fragment react when the user taps a campus building or POI.

Lines 123–139: Search handling — load data, find match, move camera, show details.
This block shows performSearch(...) scanning CampusData.getFacilities() for a name match.
When a match is found the code animates the camera to the facility’s coordinates and opens
FacilityDetailsBottomSheet with that facility’s name. If nothing matches the app shows a toast.
This connects the map UI directly to the local data source so updates in CampusData reflect on the
map.

Figure 40: Map and Local Data Integration Interface

Figure 40 above shows the map interface used in the USIU Campus Navigator, highlighting how
the Google Map view connects with the local CampusData list. This screen acts as the visual center
for location-based actions, allowing users to search for buildings, tap on points of interest, and
view facility details without opening a new activity. The map is locked within the USIU campus
boundaries, keeping the user focused on relevant locations. When a facility is selected through the
search bar or by tapping a POI, the camera moves smoothly to the exact coordinates and opens a
bottom-sheet panel with the facility’s name. This confirms that the underlying map logic and data
access functions are working together to update the UI based on the user’s actions.

3. System Intent Integration Configured Android Implicit Intents to integrate the app with the
device's core capabilities. Specifically, the ACTION_DIAL intent was integrated into the Profile
section to bridge the app with the Phone Dialer for security calls, and ACTION_SENDTO was
linked to the Email client for administrative inquiries. This ensured timely communication between
students and university services without requiring a backend messaging server.

Figure 41: System Intent Integration Logic

Figure 41 illustrates how the ProfileFragment connects the USIU Campus Navigator to built-in
device apps using Android Implicit Intents. The code snippet shows how the app triggers direct
phone calls to key university services and opens the default email client for administrative
inquiries. These integrations remove the need for an in-app messaging system while still giving
students fast access to help and support.
Lines 22–25: Inflates the Profile screen layout and calls setupClickListeners(). This prepares the
UI elements so each card can trigger the correct system action when tapped.
61 | P a g e

Lines 31–38: Handles the Campus Security card. Tapping this card launches the phone dialer using
Intent.ACTION_DIAL and loads the security office number (+254730116111) into the dialer. This
lets students start a call without typing the number.
Lines 40–47: Handles the Health Services card. The same dial intent pattern is used here, but with
the Health Services number (+254730116080). This ensures quick access to medical support.
Lines 49–56: Handles the Main Office card. A dial intent opens the phone app with the main office
number (+254730116000), providing a simple way to reach administrative staff.
Lines 58–64: Connects the “Open Map” button to the Map tab by calling navigateToMap() in
MainActivity. This keeps navigation consistent by using the same fragment-based flow as the rest
of the app.
Lines 66–78: Implements the email integration using Intent.ACTION_SENDTO with a mailto:
URI. Tapping the Email button opens the device’s mail app with the address info@usiu.ac.ke and
a pre-filled subject line. A try–catch block handles cases where no email app is installed, showing
a toast message instead of crashing.

Figure 42: System Intent Integration Interface

Figure 42 above shows the Profile interface for the USIU Campus Navigator, highlighting the
quick-access cards linked to system dial and email functions. Each card represents a key university
service—Campus Security, Health Services, and the Main Office—allowing students to open the
phone dialer with one tap. The Email button connects directly to the device’s default mail app for
inquiries. This layout gives students an easy way to reach essential services without navigating

63 | P a g e

away from the app’s main flow, confirming that the intent logic underneath is correctly routing
each action to the corresponding system app.

6.5 APIs
The USIU Campus Navigator integrates a set of essential Android and Google APIs to support
seamless interaction between its frontend logic, local data, and device hardware. These APIs play
a critical role in enabling location awareness, interactive mapping, and direct communication
channels. The effective integration of these APIs ensures real-time system responsiveness, accurate
geospatial rendering, and smooth end-user experiences across different tasks such as wayfinding
and emergency dialing.
Key APIs Used in the USIU Campus Navigator:
1. Google Maps SDK for Android: Powers the core navigation interface. It renders the vectorbased map tiles, handles camera movements (pan, zoom, tilt), and manages the coordinate system.
It allows the application to restrict the view strictly to the USIU campus boundaries, preventing
users from getting lost in the surrounding map data.

64 | P a g e

Figure 43: Google Maps SDK and Location Services Integration

Figure 42 illustrates how the MapFragment integrates the Google Maps SDK and Android
Location Services API to provide interactive, real-time geospatial functionality. The snippet
demonstrates how the fragment initializes the GoogleMap object, sets campus boundaries, enables
camera gestures, shows the "My Location" blue dot, and retrieves the device’s current position
using FusedLocationProviderClient. These APIs work together to give students a precise and
responsive campus navigation experience without leaving the app.
Lines 74–78: Initializes the GoogleMap instance (mMap) and sets a POI click listener
(setOnPoiClickListener). This allows the fragment to detect taps on campus buildings and display
detailed information in a bottom sheet.

65 | P a g e

Lines 81–83: Restricts the camera to the USIU_BOUNDS and sets minimum and maximum zoom
preferences. This prevents users from navigating outside the campus area while still allowing close
zoom for details.
Lines 87–93: Enables camera gestures including pan, zoom, tilt, and rotate while disabling zoom
controls. This ensures smooth, interactive map manipulation while keeping the UI clean.
Lines 96–111: Calls enableMyLocation(), which uses Android Location Services to check
permissions and display the blue "My Location" dot. If granted, checkUserLocation() retrieves the
device’s current latitude and longitude and animates the map to the user’s position if it lies within
campus bounds.
Lines 115–130: Implements the FusedLocationProviderClient task to get the last known location.
This allows the map to reflect real-time device positioning without continuously polling the GPS,
improving performance and battery usage.

66 | P a g e

Figure 44: Map APIs User Interface

Figure 41 above shows the interactive map interface highlighting the integration of Google Maps
SDK and Android Location Services. The "My Location" blue dot shows the student’s current
position on campus, and camera gestures allow smooth panning, zooming, and tilting of the map.
Points of interest are tappable, opening a bottom sheet with facility details, demonstrating realtime interaction between local data and device hardware. The map is constrained to the USIU
campus bounds, ensuring students remain oriented within the campus, and confirms that the API
logic correctly drives the UI for both navigation and location awareness.

2. Android Location Services API: Facilitates real-time geospatial positioning. This API
communicates with the device’s GPS hardware to retrieve the user’s current latitude and longitude.
67 | P a g e

It enables the "My Location" blue dot feature, allowing students to see their exact position relative
to campus buildings.

Figure 45: Android Location Services API Logic

Figure 45 illustrates how the MapFragment integrates the Android Location Services API to enable
real-time geospatial positioning in the USIU Campus Navigator. The snippet demonstrates how
the fragment checks for location permissions, enables the “My Location” blue dot on the map,
retrieves the user’s current GPS coordinates, and centers the map on the user while respecting
campus boundaries. This ensures that students can see their precise location relative to campus
buildings and navigate efficiently.

68 | P a g e

Lines 102–111: enableMyLocation() checks if the app has ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION
permission. If granted, it enables the blue dot and My Location button on the map. If not, it requests
permission from the user.
Lines 114–133: checkUserLocation() uses the FusedLocationProviderClient to get the last known
location of the device. If a valid location is retrieved and it is within USIU_BOUNDS, the map
camera animates to the user’s position with zoom level 18. This provides instant feedback of the
user’s position relative to campus landmarks.
Lines 135–141: onRequestPermissionsResult() handles the permission callback. If the user grants
location access, it calls enableMyLocation() to turn on the blue dot feature. This ensures a smooth
permission workflow without crashing the app.
Lines 60–67 (Map Setup): Once the GoogleMap instance is ready, onMapReady() calls
enableMyLocation() to immediately show the user’s position when the map loads.

69 | P a g e

Figure 46: Location Services Interface

Figure 46 above shows the map interface displaying the “My Location” blue dot inside the USIU
campus boundaries. This visual feedback allows students to instantly identify their position relative
to academic buildings, hostels, and other facilities. The map remains restricted to campus limits,
ensuring the user focuses only on relevant areas. Gestures such as zooming, scrolling, and tilting
are enabled so students can explore the campus interactively while the blue dot continuously
updates based on the device’s GPS. This confirms that the Android Location Services API is
correctly integrated and functional.

70 | P a g e

3. Android Telephony (Intent) API: Handles automated dialing requests sent by users when
contacting Campus Security or Health Services. This ensures clear and immediate access to
support by passing specific telephone numbers (tel:) directly to the system's native dialer.

Figure 47: Implementation of Implicit Intents for Direct Dialing Functionality.

Figure 37 focuses on the implementation of Implicit Intents for the direct dialing functionality. The
snippet details the construction of the ACTION_DIAL intent within the click listener logic. It
highlights the parsing of the telephone string into a URI format that the Android system can
interpret and the subsequent execution of startActivity(intent), which transitions the user from the
app environment to the phone's dialer interface securely and efficiently.
Line 34: Attaches an OnClickListener to the UI card with ID cardSecurity. This lambda function
waits for the user's touch interaction.
Line 35: Instantiates a new Intent object with the action Intent.ACTION_DIAL. This specific
action tells the Android system that the user wants to open the phone keypad, rather than placing
the call immediately (which would require higher permissions).
Line 36: Sets the data for the intent using Uri.parse. The string "tel:+254730116111" is parsed into
a URI that the phone dialer understands as a valid telephone number.
Line 37: Executes startActivity(intent), which pauses the current app and launches the device's
default Phone app with the USIU Security number pre-filled and ready to call.
71 | P a g e

Figure 48: Emergency contacts UI

Figure 38 above illustrates that the "Emergency Contacts" interface serves as a critical safety
feature within the USIU Campus Navigator, designed to provide immediate assistance to students,
faculty, and visitors during urgent situations. Recognizing that navigating emergency protocols
can be stressful, this module centralizes essential contact information into a single, easily
accessible screen. The interface prioritizes clarity and speed, featuring large, high-contrast action
cards for primary services such as Campus Security and the Health Center. Each card is distinctly
labeled and accompanied by intuitive iconography, ensuring that users can rapidly identify the
appropriate service without cognitive strain.

72 | P a g e

Figure 49 : Telephony API intergration UI

Figure 39 above represents the output of the Telephony API integration. When a user taps the "Call
Campus Security" card, the system transitions from the USIU Campus Navigator app to the native
Android Phone Dialer. The screen displays the number +254730116111 pre-loaded into the dial
pad, allowing the user to simply press the green call button to initiate the connection. This
mechanism ensures that users can quickly access emergency services without needing to memorize
or manually type long phone numbers, significantly enhancing safety on campus.
6.6

Application Deployment

The deployment phase of the USIU Campus Navigator was focused on packaging the application
into a secure, installable format accessible to students, faculty, and staff. This stage involved
configuring the build environment, generating signed binaries, and verifying the installation
process on physical devices to ensure smooth system operations. The frontend logic was optimized
using ProGuard to shrink code size and obfuscate proprietary logic, while the Gradle build system
73 | P a g e

was configured to manage dependencies such as the Google Maps SDK and Gson serialization
library efficiently. Special attention was given to the signing process, which ensures the integrity
of the application and prevents unauthorized modifications. Post-deployment, the application was
subjected to rigorous real-world testing to verify GPS accuracy and UI responsiveness across
different Android versions and screen sizes.
Deployment Tasks
1. Gradle Build Configuration: The project’s build.gradle file was meticulously configured to
define the application’s versioning and dependency management. The minSdkVersion was set to
API Level 24 (Android 7.0) to ensure compatibility with the majority of student devices, while the
targetSdkVersion was updated to the latest API level to leverage modern security and performance
features. Essential dependencies, including com.google.android.gms:play-services-maps and
com.google.code.gson:gson, were implemented to support the core mapping and data persistence
functionalities.

Figure 50:Gradle Build Configuration – Top-Level File

Figure 50 illustrates the top-level build.gradle file of the project. It shows how configuration
options common to all modules are defined. This file sets up the Android application plugin using
the project’s libs.versions.toml aliases, keeping the project organized and allowing individual
modules to apply the plugin as needed.

Lines 2-4: The plugins block defines plugins for the project. alias(libs.plugins.android.application)
apply false registers the Android application plugin but does not apply it here. This allows separate
modules to apply the plugin in their own build.gradle files.

2. APK Signing and Generation: To prepare the application for distribution, a signed Android
Package Kit (APK) was generated using Android Studio’s build tools. A secure release keystore
was created to digitally sign the APK, a mandatory step that verifies the developer's identity and
ensures the app's integrity. This cryptographic signature prevents the installation of tampered
versions and allows for seamless future updates without data loss for the user.

Lines 1-3: The plugins block applies the Android application plugin to this module, enabling
Android-specific build features.
Lines 5-7: The android block sets the project namespace and the compile SDK version,
determining which Android API the app is compiled against.
Lines 9-16: The defaultConfig block defines essential app properties, including the application
ID, minSdk, targetSdk, version code, and version name. It also specifies the test instrumentation
runner.
Lines 18-26: The buildTypes block defines the release build. isMinifyEnabled = false disables
code shrinking, and proguardFiles specifies ProGuard rules to optimize and protect the code. A
signing configuration can be added here to digitally sign the APK for distribution.
Lines 27-30: compileOptions ensures the app uses Java 11 features and sets compatibility with
Java 11 source and target code.
Lines 32-44: The dependencies block lists all external libraries required by the app, including
Google Maps, location services, Dexter for permissions, Gson for JSON handling, and standard
Android libraries.
3. Physical Device Testing: The signed APK was side-loaded onto a variety of physical Android
devices, ranging from entry-level smartphones to high-resolution tablets. This step verified that
hardware-dependent features, specifically the GPS sensors and Compass, functioned correctly in
the real-world campus environment. It also confirmed that the Material Design XML layouts
adapted responsive to different screen densities and aspect ratios.

7 CHAPTER 7: TESTING AND EVALUATION
7.1

Introduction

This chapter outlines the comprehensive testing and evaluation efforts conducted on the USIU
Campus Navigator to ensure its robustness, accuracy, and usability. The testing phase was essential
in validating the performance of key modules, such as interactive map rendering, facility
searching, navigation routing, and user authentication. It focused on confirming that all features
functioned correctly and securely across different user roles, including students, faculty, and
administrators.
A variety of testing strategies were applied, including functionality testing to verify individual
features, interface testing to assess responsiveness and user interactions, and location-based testing
to ensure the Google Maps API integration worked precisely within campus boundaries.
Additional evaluations examined the system's ability to maintain data consistency in the local
database, handle simultaneous navigation requests, and enforce proper access restrictions. The
insights gained from these processes guided refinements and ensured the system met performance
expectations for reliable campus navigation and facility discovery.
In addition to these core evaluations, usability testing was performed to gauge how intuitively
users could navigate the system and perform common tasks such as searching for a building,
generating a route, or filtering facility categories. Feedback from actual users during simulated
usage scenarios helped identify minor UI inefficiencies and areas for clarity improvement, which
were promptly addressed. Moreover, compatibility testing was carried out across various Android
devices and screen sizes to confirm the system's consistent behavior and visual integrity. These
iterative testing cycles ensured that the USIU Campus Navigator not only met its technical
requirements but also delivered a smooth and accessible user experience suitable for the university
community.
7.2

System Testing

System testing is a critical phase in the software development lifecycle that involves evaluating
the complete and integrated software product to ensure it complies with the specified requirements.
Unlike unit or integration testing, which focus on individual components or modules, system
testing validates the application as a unified whole in an environment that closely mimics real83 | P a g e

world use. The primary objective is to verify that the system meets both functional specifications—
what the system does, and non-functional requirements, how the system performs, such as security,
speed, and reliability. This comprehensive evaluation is essential to identify and rectify any defects
that may arise when different modules interact, ensuring the final deliverable is robust and ready
for deployment.
For the USIU Campus Navigator, system testing played a pivotal role in validating the performance
and reliability of the android application under realistic campus scenarios. This phase was designed
to verify that the system's integrated modules—such as the interactive map rendering, facility
search algorithms, secure user authentication, and route generation logic—operated seamlessly as
a cohesive unit. The testing process involved installing the application on various Android devices
to simulate the actual experience of students and faculty navigating the university grounds.
The objective was to assess the system’s ability to meet specific non-functional requirements
defined during the analysis phase. Emphasis was placed on validating Security (NFR2) to ensure
safe access, Performance (NFR1) to guarantee rapid route generation, and Scalability (NFR5) to
confirm the system can handle growth. The upcoming subsections detail these specific test
categories, supported by actual test cases, code snippets, and interface screenshots that highlight
the effectiveness of the system under diverse conditions.
7.2.1

Reliability & Data Consistency Testing

Reliability testing for the USIU Campus Navigator focused on validating the system's ability to
maintain data integrity without a remote server, adhering to NFR4: Reliability Requirements.
Since the application operates without user accounts, ensuring that locally saved data—specifically
the "Favorite" facilities—persists across sessions is critical for user trust. This testing phase
evaluated the stability of the SharedPreferences implementation and the serialization logic handled
by the Gson library.
The primary objective was to verify that data writes are committed successfully to the device's
internal storage and that data reads retrieve the exact state left by the user. Test scenarios simulated
common real-world interruptions, such as force-closing the application or restarting the device, to
confirm that the "Favorites" list remained consistent and was not lost. This ensures the application

84 | P a g e

meets the 95% availability and data consistency standard defined in the non-functional
requirements.

Figure 56 : JSON Serialization and Persistence Logic using Gson and SharedPreferences.

Figure 56 demonstrates how the app manages the storage and retrieval of the user's favorite
facilities. The code uses SharedPreferences to save the list locally on the device and Gson to
convert between JSON strings and Java objects. This ensures that the user’s favorite facilities are
preserved across app launches and can be restored automatically, providing a seamless and
personalized experience.
Lines 136–137: The loadFavorites method attempts to retrieve a string from the private
SharedPreferences file using the key "favorite_facilities". If the app is being launched for the first
time, this returns null.
Lines 138–140: If data exists, the system uses TypeToken to define the complex list structure
(ArrayList<Facility>). The gson.fromJson method then parses the stored JSON string back into
usable Java objects, restoring the user's data.

85 | P a g e

Lines 146–147: The saveFavorites method captures the current state of the favoriteFacilities list
and converts it into a JSON string using gson.toJson.
Line 148: The sharedPreferences.edit() method is called to open a transaction. The string is saved,
and apply() is used to commit the changes asynchronously to the disk, ensuring the data is safe
even if the app crashes immediately after.

The reliability test cases presented in Table 2 were meticulously designed to validate the robustness
of the local data storage system under various conditions. TC01 confirmed the basic functionality
of the write operation, verifying that user interactions in the UI correctly trigger the backend logic
to update the list in memory. TC02 served as the critical stress test for NFR4. By force-closing the
application, the test simulated a crash or a system restart, which clears the device's Random Access
Memory (RAM). The successful retrieval of the "Cafeteria" item upon relaunch proved that the
Gson serialization and SharedPreferences commit logic function correctly, writing data to the
persistent storage (disk) rather than just temporary memory. Finally, TC03 verified that data
updates, specifically deletions, are also persistent. This ensures that the database maintains an
accurate reflection of the user's current preferences and does not retain stale or unwanted data.
Collectively, these results confirm that the system meets the high reliability requirements for data
consistency.

87 | P a g e

Figure 57: Favorites fragment UI

The figure above presents the "Favorites" fragment populated with the "Library" facility card,
captured immediately after a simulated application restart. This visual output serves as definitive
proof that the deserialization logic within the loadFavorites() method correctly retrieved the JSON
string from the device's internal storage and reconstructed the Facility java objects without data
loss. The presence of the facility card in the RecyclerView, rather than the default "No Favorites
Yet" empty state view, confirms that the SharedPreferences read operation was successful.
Furthermore, the specific state of the UI elements, such as the filled red "Heart" icon and the
accurate retention of the facility’s name and category details, validates that the integrity of the
complex object data was maintained through the serialization process.
From a reliability perspective (NFR4), this interface demonstrates the system's ability to handle
session interruptions gracefully. The successful rendering of this view confirms that the backend
88 | P a g e

write operation (saveFavorites) committed the data to the disk permanently, rather than holding it
in volatile memory (RAM) which would have been cleared upon closing the app. This behavior
ensures that students can rely on the application to retain their personalized schedules and preferred
locations even if their device reboots or the operating system kills the background process to save
battery. The seamless restoration of this state meets the requirement for 95% system availability
and consistent data retention, providing a trustworthy and personalized user experience.
7.2.2

Performance Testing

Performance testing was conducted to rigorously evaluate the responsiveness of the USIU Campus
Navigator, ensuring it aligns with NFR1: Performance Requirements. The primary metric for this
evaluation was the system's ability to execute critical navigation commands—specifically map
rendering, route calculation, and camera movements—within the stipulated 3–5 second threshold
defined in the requirements phase. Since the application relies heavily on the Google Maps SDK
for Android, testing focused on measuring the latency between a user's input (such as tapping a
facility card) and the completion of the corresponding visual response (the camera zooming to the
specific coordinates).
Unlike server-dependent applications, where performance is often dictated by internet bandwidth,
the performance of this application is largely dependent on efficient local resource management
and the rendering speed of the underlying vector tiles. The tests measured the execution time of
the animateCamera method and the initialization speed of the SupportMapFragment. This phase
was essential to confirm that the application remains fluid and responsive, preventing "Application
Not Responding" (ANR) errors even when the user rapidly switches between different campus
locations or zooms in and out of complex building clusters. By validating these metrics, the testing
ensured that the system delivers a seamless navigation experience suitable for students moving
quickly between classes.

Figure 58: Programmatic Camera Animation Triggered by Quick Access Card Interaction.

Figure 58 demonstrates how the app handles user interaction with the Library card and measures
performance. When the user taps the card, the system captures the touch event, calculates the target
GPS coordinates, and animates the map smoothly to the Library location. Defensive checks ensure
the map is ready before performing the animation, maintaining app stability. This process not only
provides a responsive navigation experience but also allows the system to measure performance
for the non-functional requirement related to UI responsiveness.
Line 108: This line attaches a click listener to the specific UI card element identified by
R.id.cardLibrary. The system now actively listens for user interaction on this view. This is the
starting point for the performance test measurement; the timer starts the moment the user's finger
lifts from the screen.
Line 109: Instantiates a new LatLng object with the specific hardcoded GPS coordinates for the
Library (-1.2138, 36.8792). This operation allocates memory for the location object. While
typically instant, efficient memory allocation here is crucial to prevent garbage collection pauses
that could cause UI stutter during the animation start.
Line 110: Performs a null check on the mMap object. This is a defensive programming step to
ensure the map is fully initialized and ready to receive commands. It prevents potential crashes
(NullPointerExceptions) if the user taps the card before the map tiles have finished loading,
contributing to the overall stability and perceived performance of the app.
Line 111: Executes the core navigation command: mMap.animateCamera. This method instructs
the Google Maps engine to calculate a smooth flight path from the current camera position to the
target library coordinates. It also adjusts the zoom level to 17f. The execution of this single line
triggers complex rendering calculations in the background; the speed at which this animation

The performance test cases detailed in Table 7.2 were specifically designed to benchmark the
system against the latency requirements of NFR1. TC04 focused on the "cold start" time, validating
that the heavy Google Maps SDK initializes quickly enough to not frustrate users upon launch.
The result of 1.8 seconds confirms that the asynchronous map loading in onMapReady is
functioning efficiently. TC05 tested the primary interaction loop—navigating to a facility. The 1.2second response time is well within the 3–5 second acceptable window, ensuring a fluid user
experience. Finally, TC06 simulated an impatient user rapidly switching targets. The system's
ability to handle these interrupt requests without crashing or freezing confirms the robustness of
the animation logic and memory management.

Figure 59: Quick access cards

Figure 53 above demonstrates the visual output of the performance test. The screenshot captures
the moment immediately following a user interaction with the "Library" Quick Access card. The
map camera has successfully centered on the Library building (indicated by the red marker) and
zoomed to the optimal level of 17.0f, clearly displaying the building's footprint and surrounding
pathways. The fluidity of this transition—from the initial wide campus view to this focused state—
occurring in approximately 1.2 seconds, visually confirms the system's adherence to the
performance requirement (NFR1). The lack of rendering artifacts or blank tiles further validates
the efficiency of the map initialization logic.
7.2.3

Scalability Testing

Scalability testing was conducted to assess the system's capacity to handle growth, specifically the
addition of new campus infrastructure, as outlined in NFR5: Scalability Requirements. While the
93 | P a g e

current version of the USIU Campus Navigator includes over 40 facilities, the requirement dictates
that the system must accommodate an increasing number of buildings, departments, and routes as
the university expands. Therefore, this testing phase focused on the adaptability of the local
database architecture and the rendering efficiency of the UI components when handling
significantly larger datasets.
The evaluation centered on the FacilitiesAdapter and its underlying RecyclerView implementation.
Unlike static layouts (such as ListView or ScrollView) which degrade in performance and consume
excessive memory as content is added, the RecyclerView is architected to recycle views, ensuring
that memory usage remains constant regardless of whether the list contains 50 or 500 items. Test
scenarios involved stress-testing the adapter by verifying that scrolling remains smooth
(maintaining 60 frames per second) and that the search filtering logic continues to function
instantly without lag, even if the facility list doubles in size. This confirms that the application is
future-proof and ready to scale alongside USIU's physical growth.

Figure 60 : Logic for Binding Data to UI Elements in the Recycler View Adapter.

Figure 60 demonstrates how the app efficiently displays facility data in a scrollable list using a
RecyclerView adapter. The code reuses existing view holders for each list item, retrieves the
corresponding facility data, and binds it to the UI elements. Conditional logic updates the status
indicator without inflating new layouts, ensuring smooth scrolling and responsive performance
even with large data sets.

94 | P a g e

Line 49: The onBindViewHolder method is called every time a new item scrolls onto the screen.
It receives a recycled holder object rather than creating a new one. This is the key to scalability:
even if the list has 1,000 items, this method reuses the same ~8 view objects already in memory.
Line 50: Retrieves the specific Facility data object for the current list position (O(1) operation),
ensuring instant data access regardless of list size.
Lines 52-53: Binds the data strings to the UI elements. Because the text views are already cached
in the holder, there is no expensive layout inflation occurring here, keeping the scroll frame rate
high (60fps).
Lines 56-60: Executes the conditional logic for the status indicator. Instead of inflating different
layouts for "Open" vs "Closed," it simply modifies attributes of the existing text view. This
efficiency prevents UI stutter during rapid scrolling.

Figure 61 : Structure of the ViewHolder Class for Optimized View Lookup.

95 | P a g e

Lines 152-153: The getItemCount method returns the total size of the dataset. The RecyclerView
calls this constantly to calculate scrollbar sizing. By returning facilityList.size(), the app ensures
accurate scrolling dimensions whether the list contains 10 items or 10,000 items.
Lines 156-166: The FacilityViewHolder static class implements the "View Holder Pattern."
•

Line 160: The constructor calls super(itemView), holding the reference to the root view
layout.

•

Lines 162-164: It calls findViewById exactly once when the item is first created. These
references (tvFacilityName, etc.) are stored in memory. This prevents the system from
having to search the XML tree every time the user scrolls a pixel, which is the number one
cause of lag in non-scalable apps.

The table 3 above displays the Facilities Directory interface during the scalability stress test. The
screenshot shows the RecyclerView successfully rendering a densely populated list of facility
cards. Despite the high volume of data items loaded into the adapter, the UI remains clean and
responsive, with status indicators (Gold/Red) rendering correctly for each item. The smooth
alignment of text and icons confirms that the layout manager is efficiently recycling views, while

97 | P a g e

the presence of the scrollbar indicates that the list extends well beyond the visible screen area,
handling the large dataset without visual glitches or layout breakage.
The scalability tests detailed in Table 7.3 were designed to stress-test the application's architecture
against future growth scenarios.
TC07 verified the efficiency of the RecyclerView. By injecting 500 items—far more than the
current 40—the test confirmed that the recycling logic prevents the "Out of Memory" errors
common in older list implementations. The scrolling remained fluid, proving that the memory
footprint does not grow linearly with the dataset size.
TC08 tested the algorithmic efficiency of the search filter. The near-instant result (300ms) proves
that the local filtering logic is optimized enough to handle a much larger database without needing
a backend server search. This responsiveness ensures that as the campus grows and more facilities
are added, students can still find their destination instantly.
TC09 provided technical validation of the ViewHolder pattern. The stable memory graph confirms
that the app is not leaking memory as it renders new rows, ensuring it remains stable even on older
devices with limited RAM. This stability is critical for scalability, as it guarantees that adding new
buildings in the future will not degrade the user experience for students with entry-level
smartphones.
7.3

User Acceptance Testing (UAT)

User Acceptance Testing (UAT) was conducted to verify that the USIU Campus Navigator met its
core functional objectives and offered a seamless experience across all target user groups,
including new students, faculty, staff, and campus visitors. The primary aim was to assess whether
the system could support accurate real-time navigation, provide instant facility status updates,
maintain local data persistence, and ensure stability during offline usage. Testing involved real
participants performing common daily tasks within the application to evaluate responsiveness,
geospatial accuracy, and overall usability.
The UAT scenarios were designed around the system’s primary operational goals. Students
successfully located academic buildings and amenities using the interactive map and search filters,
while the "Smart Status" logic provided accurate operating hours with helpful visual cues. Users
verified that their "Favorite" locations were retained across sessions, confirming the reliability of
98 | P a g e

the local storage. Performance testing under varying network conditions confirmed that the
application remained robust and functional even without active internet connectivity. Overall, the
system was validated as intuitive, reliable, and aligned with the navigation needs of the USIU
community, with only minor UI refinements noted.
7.3.1

Real-Time Navigation & Search

This objective ensures users can instantly locate campus facilities through the platform's interface.
The navigation feature serves as the primary tool for spatial orientation, allowing users to search
for specific buildings by name or category, view their precise location on the interactive map, and
access detailed information such as operating hours and descriptions. By integrating a responsive
search bar with the underlying Google Maps logic, the system aims to eliminate the confusion
often faced by new students when navigating complex campus environments.
UAT focused on verifying that the search mechanism is accessible, functional, and responsive
across various Android devices. Testers evaluated the accuracy of the auto-complete suggestions
and the speed at which the map camera updated to reflect the selected destination. Additionally,
the tests confirmed that tapping a result correctly triggered the associated bottom sheet details,
ensuring a seamless transition from search to information retrieval without visual lag or data errors.
This rigorous validation ensures that the navigation workflow remains fluid and reliable under
real-world usage.

99 | P a g e

Figure 62: Real-Time Navigation & Search Test

Figure 62 demonstrates how the app’s real-time navigation and search functionality is tested using
Android’s JUnit framework. The test simulates a user clicking the search icon, typing “Library,”
selecting the top result from the facilities list, and verifying that the correct details appear in the
bottom sheet. This ensures that the search and navigation logic works correctly and updates the UI
as expected, providing confidence in the system’s real-world behavior.
Line 1: Annotates the method with @Test, instructing the Android JUnit runner to execute this
specific case during the UAT phase.
Line 4: Uses the onView matcher to locate the search icon by its ID (R.id.action_search) and

Status

The User Acceptance Test cases detailed in Table 7.4 were conducted to validate the search and
navigation features from an end-user perspective, ensuring the system meets the functional
requirements for facility discovery.
TC11 confirmed the responsiveness and accuracy of the search functionality. When the user typed
"Library" into the search bar, the system instantly filtered the extensive facility list to display the
relevant card. The successful execution of this test verifies that the local search algorithm is
efficient and provides immediate feedback, eliminating the need for users to manually scroll
through long lists to find a specific destination.
TC12 verified the core "wayfinding" promise of the application. By tapping the search result, the
user was successfully oriented to the correct physical location on the map. The test confirmed that
the intent triggered by the selection correctly passed the coordinate data to the map camera,
centering the view on the target building. This seamless transition from list to map is critical for
ensuring users can quickly bridge the gap between identifying a facility and knowing where it is
located.
TC13 tested the flexibility of the search logic, specifically regarding category filtering. The system
successfully displayed all dining-related facilities (e.g., "Cafeteria," "Pizza Inn") when the generic
term "Food" was entered. This result confirms that the search mechanism is robust enough to
handle categorical queries, ensuring that users can discover groups of facilities even if they do not
know the specific name of a building.

102 | P a g e

Figure 63: Search bar response

The figure 57 above captures the system's response immediately after a user searches for "Library"
and selects the result. The screenshot demonstrates two critical outcomes: first, the search bar
successfully filtered the facility list to show the correct target, and second, the map camera
automatically updated to center on the Library building, displayed at an optimal zoom level. The
presence of the bottom sheet displaying "Library" confirms that the navigation intent was
successfully executed, providing the user with immediate context and access to further details.
This visual evidence validates the effectiveness of the real-time navigation feature in guiding users
to their desired destinations.

103 | P a g e

7.3.2

Smart Facility Status Validation

This objective focuses on validating the accuracy and reliability of the "Smart Status" system,
which serves as a critical decision-support tool for students and faculty. The feature is designed to
automatically determine whether a facility is "Open" or "Closed" by cross-referencing the device’s
current system time against a predefined schedule of operating hours. During UAT, testers
simulated various time-based scenarios—such as checking academic buildings late at night or
sports facilities on weekends—to verify that the status indicators updated dynamically and
correctly.
The evaluation prioritized user trust; incorrect status information could lead to wasted trips and
user frustration. Therefore, testing involved checking edge cases, such as the transition minute
when a facility closes (e.g., 5:00 PM), to ensure the UI reflects the change instantly. Users
confirmed that the visual cues—Gold for "Open" and Red for "Closed"—were intuitive and helpful
for planning their campus movements. This validation ensures that the application provides
actionable, real-time intelligence that aligns with the actual operational schedule of USIU Africa.

104 | P a g e

Figure 64: Smart Facility Status Validation Test

Figure 64 demonstrates how the app verifies the accuracy of facility operating status using unit
tests. The code simulates different times and days for various facilities—academic, administrative,
and sports—to ensure the system correctly identifies whether each facility is “Open” or “Closed.”
This testing confirms that the time-based and day-of-week logic is functioning properly, preventing
users from seeing incorrect facility availability in real-world use.
Line 1: Annotates the method with @Test, identifying it as a unit test case to be executed by the
JUnit runner.
Lines 4–6: Sets up the first test scenario for an "Academic" facility. It creates a mock Calendar
object and manually sets the time to 10:00 AM, simulating a standard school day morning.
Line 9: Executes the assertion assertEquals("Open", ...). This line critically verifies that the logic
correctly identifies 10 AM as an operating hour for the library. If the logic returns "Closed," the
test fails immediately.

105 | P a g e

Lines 12–14: Sets up a specific edge case for "Admin" offices. It creates a mock time object set
to Calendar.SUNDAY. This tests the day-of-week logic, ensuring offices are marked closed even
if the user checks at 10 AM on a weekend.
Line 17: Validates that the registrar.calculateStatus method returns "Closed," confirming the
weekend restriction logic is functioning.
Lines 20–22: Sets up a time-based boundary test for "Sports" facilities. It sets the time to 18:00 (6
PM), which is one hour after the standard 5 PM closing time.
Line 25: Asserts that the status is "Closed," proving that the logic correctly handles the end-of-day
transition.

107 | P a g e

TC14 confirmed the standard positive case. By simulating a typical weekday morning, the test
verified that the system correctly interprets the "Open" condition for administrative offices,
providing users with accurate information for planning their visits.
TC15 tested the specific day-of-week constraint. Since administrative offices are closed on
weekends, this test ensured that the logic correctly overrides the time-of-day check (2:00 PM is
usually open) with the day-of-week check (Sunday is closed). The successful result prevents users
from making wasted trips to campus on weekends.
TC16 validated the boundary condition at the exact minute of closing. By checking the status at
5:01 PM, just one minute after the standard closing time, the test confirmed that the system is
precise and responsive. This accuracy is crucial for students rushing to submit documents or make
inquiries at the end of the day.

The figure 59 above captures the Facilities Directory interface during a live test conducted at 6:30
PM on a weekday. The screenshot visually validates the logic tested in Table 7.5. The "Library"
card (Academic) correctly displays an "Open" status in Gold text, reflecting its extended hours
until 11:00 PM. In contrast, the "Registrar" card (Administrative) directly below it displays a
"Closed" status in Red text, confirming that the system successfully recognized the 5:00 PM cutoff

Conclusion

The testing and evaluation phases played a vital role in validating the functionality, reliability, and
scalability of the USIU Campus Navigator. These processes ensured the system met its operational
goals—streamlining campus navigation, enabling intelligent facility discovery, and supporting
real-time status tracking for all user roles.
Multiple testing methodologies were applied across the system lifecycle, including unit testing for
individual components, integration testing for Google Maps and local data interactions, system
testing for end-to-end workflows, and user acceptance testing (UAT) to verify that the platform
aligns with stakeholder expectations. Manual validations on physical devices helped simulate
realistic user interactions and edge cases, such as navigating without internet access or switching
rapidly between tabs.
Evaluation extended beyond correctness to cover performance, usability, and stability.
Performance benchmarks confirmed that the application initializes the map and filters search
results within acceptable time limits (under 2 seconds). Usability assessments confirmed that the
interface is intuitive for new students and visitors alike. Data handling and persistence mechanisms
were reviewed to ensure that user favorites are retained reliably across sessions without data loss.
Ultimately, this rigorous testing and evaluation ensured that the USIU Campus Navigator is not
only functionally complete but also resilient, user-friendly, and maintainable—ready for realworld deployment on campus and future scalability.

8 CHAPTER 8: CONCLUSION
8.1

Introduction

This final chapter offers a comprehensive summary of the USIU Campus Navigator project,
reflecting on its primary objectives, architectural design, implementation outcomes, and the
technical challenges encountered during development. The application was developed to address
the persistent challenges new students and visitors face in navigating the complex USIU Africa
campus layout. It provides a centralized, mobile-first solution that promotes spatial awareness,
accessibility, and independence through interactive mapping and real-time facility information.
Initial background research highlighted the inefficiencies of relying on physical signage or verbal
directions, which are often static, easily missed, or unavailable during off-hours. By analyzing
existing navigation solutions, it became evident that while general map applications exist, they
lack the specific, granular detail required for a university environment—such as specific office
hours or interior building details. These insights shaped the vision for the USIU Campus
Navigator: to build a responsive, offline-capable, and institution-specific tool that bridges the gap
between general mapping and campus life.
The system’s primary aim was to simplify campus navigation through intuitive map interfaces and
smart status logic. Specific objectives included: restricting the camera view to campus boundaries
to prevent disorientation, implementing a "Smart Status" feature to indicate facility availability,
and ensuring data persistence for user favorites without requiring internet connectivity. These
goals were crucial in shaping the development workflow, prioritizing local resource management
over cloud dependencies to ensure reliability.
Development was executed in structured phases: requirements gathering, architectural design,
native Android implementation, and rigorous testing. A detailed project timeline guided the
process, allowing for the early identification of risks such as GPS inaccuracy or permission
handling errors. This approach facilitated the smooth coordination of frontend XML layouts and
backend Java logic, ensuring a cohesive final product.

Various design techniques, including UML Class diagrams, Activity flowcharts, and Wireframes,
were applied to visualize the application's logic before coding began. These artifacts helped refine
the user journey, ensuring that critical features like the "Emergency Call" button and "Quick
Access" carousel were placed prominently for maximum usability. Key attributes such as
performance, battery efficiency, and accessibility were prioritized throughout the design phase.
Implementation centered on building a native Android application using Java for logic and XML
for the user interface. The integration of the Google Maps SDK provided the core geospatial
engine, while SharedPreferences and Gson handled local data storage. The platform was deployed
and tested on physical devices to ensure GPS precision and UI responsiveness across different
screen sizes. Challenges such as handling Fragment transaction states and optimizing map
rendering were resolved through iterative debugging and code optimization.
The platform underwent extensive testing, including Unit Testing for logic, System Testing for
navigation flows, and User Acceptance Testing (UAT) to verify all core functionalities. Particular
attention was given to the accuracy of the "Smart Status" algorithm and the speed of route
visualization. The testing phase confirmed the system's reliability in guiding users to their
destinations and providing accurate, actionable facility information.
In summary, the USIU Campus Navigator project successfully transformed the manual, often
frustrating task of campus wayfinding into a streamlined digital experience. The system enhanced
accessibility, improved user confidence through real-time data, and provided a robust tool for the
university community. Despite technical hurdles, the final deployment demonstrates a fully
functional, professional-grade application ready for daily use, with a clear path for future
innovations such as indoor navigation and calendar integration.

Achievements

Significant milestones were accomplished during the development of the USIU Campus
Navigator, particularly in modernizing how students and visitors interact with the campus
environment. One of the key accomplishments was the successful integration of the Google Maps
SDK with custom boundary restrictions. This feature transformed a generic map into a focused,

114 | P a g e

institution-specific tool that prevents users from losing their orientation, ensuring that the user
experience remains strictly relevant to USIU Africa.
The Facilities Directory was built to provide users with comprehensive access to campus
information. This module successfully categorized over 40 facilities ranging from academic blocks
to dining areas making them searchable and accessible within milliseconds. The implementation
of the "Smart Status" logic was a major functional success; by automatically calculating whether
a facility is "Open" or "Closed" based on the current day and time, the system provides actionable
real-time intelligence that saves users time and effort.
Another major success was the development of a Local-First Architecture using SharedPreferences
and Gson. This achievement ensured that the application remains fully functional offline, a critical
requirement for reliability in areas with spotty network coverage. Users can save their favorite
locations, and this data persists across app restarts without the need for a cloud database or user
login, significantly enhancing privacy and speed.
In addition, the platform included Direct Integration with Android Services to enhance safety and
usability. The "Profile" section successfully bridged the gap between the app and the phone's native
hardware, allowing users to dial Campus Security or Health Services with a single tap. This
integration transforms the app from a simple directory into a practical safety tool.
Lastly, the user interface was polished to meet Material Design 3 standards, featuring consistent
USIU branding, responsive layouts, and intuitive navigation patterns. The Quick Access Carousel
on the map interface addressed the "cold start" problem, guiding new users to popular destinations
immediately upon launch. Thorough testing, ranging from unit tests for time logic to field testing
on physical devices, verified that each feature functioned correctly, resulting in a stable,
professional-grade application ready for deployment.
8.3

Challenges Encountered

Although the USIU Campus Navigator was successfully built and deployed, the development
process presented several technical and functional hurdles that required rigorous problem-solving.
One of the primary difficulties was ensuring the persistence of the map state during navigation
115 | P a g e

transitions. Early in the development phase, switching between the "Map" and "Facilities" tabs
caused the Google Map instance to reload, resetting the user’s camera position and zoom level.
This disrupted the user experience significantly. Resolving this required a shift in the fragment
management strategy, moving from simple replacement transactions to a more complex hide-andshow logic within the MainActivity, ensuring the map instance remained active in the background.
Another complex challenge involved managing the Camera Boundary Restrictions to keep the user
focused on the campus. Determining the precise latitude and longitude coordinates for the
Southwest and Northeast corners of USIU required extensive testing. Initially, the bounds were
too tight, preventing users from viewing the outskirts of the campus, or too loose, allowing them
to scroll into neighboring estates. Fine-tuning these coordinates and configuring the
setLatLngBoundsForCameraTarget method required multiple iterations to achieve a balance
between usability and restriction.
Implementing the "Smart Status" logic also posed logical challenges, particularly regarding edge
cases in the operating schedule. The initial algorithm struggled to correctly handle weekends for
administrative offices, occasionally marking them as "Open" on Saturdays. This required rewriting
the Calendar logic to include strict day-of-week checks alongside hour-of-day comparisons.
Additionally, handling Runtime Permissions for GPS access proved intricate across different
Android versions. Ensuring that the application did not crash if a user denied location permissions
required implementing robust fallback logic that allowed the app to function in "Manual Mode"
without the blue location dot.
Finally, ensuring UI responsiveness across different device screen sizes presented a significant
design challenge. The facility cards in the directory occasionally rendered with overlapping text
on smaller, older devices. This required optimizing the XML layouts using ConstraintLayout and
defining flexible dimensions rather than fixed pixel sizes. Despite these issues, persistent
debugging, field testing on physical devices, and code optimization helped overcome these
setbacks. The result was a stable, resilient application capable of supporting reliable campus
navigation for all users.

Future Work

While the current version of the USIU Campus Navigator meets its core objectives of providing
reliable outdoor navigation and facility information, there are several opportunities to expand its
capabilities and deepen its integration with campus life in future iterations. One key area for
enhancement is the development of Indoor Navigation. Currently, the application guides users to
the entrance of a building. Future work will involve mapping the interiors of complex multi-story
structures, such as the Library and the Science Center, to provide floor-by-floor guidance to
specific classrooms, offices, or labs. This would significantly reduce the "last-mile" confusion
students face once they enter a large building.
Another promising direction involves the integration of Augmented Reality (AR) technology. By
leveraging the camera and compass sensors, a future module could overlay digital directional
arrows onto the real-world view of the campus path. This "Live View" feature would provide an
intuitive, immersive wayfinding experience, particularly useful for visitors who struggle to
interpret 2D top-down maps. Additionally, implementing Real-Time Crowd Monitoring using
anonymous location data could help students avoid congested areas, such as a full cafeteria during
lunch hours, by suggesting less crowded alternatives.
To further personalize the user experience, future iterations will focus on Academic Calendar
Integration. By connecting to the university’s student portal API, the application could
automatically pull a student’s class schedule and highlight the exact building they need to be in for
their next lecture. This feature would transform the app from a passive directory into an active
daily assistant. Furthermore, accessibility can be improved by introducing Multi-Language
Support and a system-wide Dark Theme, ensuring the application serves the diverse needs of the
international student body and remains comfortable to use during evening classes.
Finally, the system infrastructure could be scaled to support Events and News integration. A
dynamic "Events Layer" on the map could highlight temporary venues for graduation, orientation,
or club activities, complete with navigation to specific tents or stalls. With these enhancements,
the USIU Campus Navigator is well-positioned to evolve from a static navigation tool into a
comprehensive, intelligent campus companion that adapts to the dynamic nature of university life.

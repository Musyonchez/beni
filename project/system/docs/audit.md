## 🔴 Critical Bugs (breaks functionality)

### ✅ B1 — Cart icon uses wrong lookup key
**Fixed in commit `5acf989`** — added `category` to `CartItem`, now used for icon lookup.

### ✅ B2 — No stock deduction on order placement
**Fixed in commit `efc55fb`** — stock check + `$inc` deduction added to order creation.

### ✅ B3 — Product creation fails when location is empty
**Fixed in commit `5edebf0`** — location and locationName are now optional in both model and route.

### B4 — M-Pesa callback can't find order
**File:** `backend/src/routes/payments.ts` lines 70–78  
```js
Order.findOne({ _id: { $regex: suffix + '$', $options: 'i' } })
```
MongoDB ObjectId fields cannot be queried with `$regex` — this query will never match. Orders will never be marked as paid via callback.  
**Fix:** Add a `reference` field to the Order model (last 6 chars of `_id`), index it, and query by that field in the callback.

### ✅ B5 — Map nearby radius is 20,000× too large
**Fixed in commit `e2771fb`** — changed `radius: 20000` to `radius: 20` (km).

### ✅ B6 — Express 4 async errors bypass errorHandler
**Fixed in commit `e2771fb`** — added `express-async-errors` to `index.ts`.

### ✅ B7 — Out-of-stock products can still be added to cart
**Fixed in commit `29378b7`** — button replaced with "Out of Stock" pill when `quantity === 0`.

## 🟠 Missing Features (gaps users will notice)

### F1 — No profile / account page
Backend has `PUT /api/auth/me` (update name, phone, location) and `PUT /api/auth/password` but no frontend page uses them. Users cannot update their profile or change their password after registering.  
**Fix:** Add `/account` page accessible from Navbar for logged-in users (both roles). Form fields: name, phone, location name. Separate section for password change.

### ✅ F2 — AuthContext User type missing fields
**Fixed in commit `pending`** — `User` interface extended with `phone?`, `isVerified?`, `avgRating?`, `profilePhoto?`. These are returned by login/register and now flow through to components.

### F3 — Browse search only covers loaded page
**File:** `frontend/src/app/browse/page.tsx` lines 48–51  
Search filters `products` array which is only the current page (12 items). If 50 products exist, searching only covers the first 12 loaded.  
**Fix:** Either (a) pass `search` as a query param to the backend and add text search there, or (b) show a note "Searching loaded products only — load more to search all."

### F4 — No mobile-friendly Navbar
**File:** `frontend/src/components/Navbar.tsx`  
The nav links are all in a single flex row. On small screens (phone) they'll wrap or overflow.  
**Fix:** Add a hamburger menu that toggles a dropdown on mobile (`sm:hidden` / `hidden sm:flex` pattern).

### ✅ F5 — No role guard on protected routes
**Fixed in commit `pending`** — `AuthGuard` now accepts `role?: 'buyer' | 'farmer'`; farmer layout uses `role="farmer"`, cart and orders layouts use `role="buyer"`. Wrong-role users are redirected to their home page.

### ✅ F6 — Admin redirect goes to /admin which doesn't exist
**Fixed in commit `pending`** — admin role now redirects to `/browse` until an admin dashboard is built.

---

## 🟡 UX Issues (minor but visible)

### ✅ U1 — KES amounts not formatted with commas
**Fixed in commit `pending`** — all KES amounts across orders, cart, farmer, browse, map, product detail, and MapView now use `.toLocaleString()`.

### U2 — Cart + button doesn't respect stock on cart page
**File:** `frontend/src/app/(protected)/cart/page.tsx` line 89  
Product detail page caps quantity at `product.quantity`, but on the cart page the `+` button calls `updateQuantity(id, quantity + 1)` with no upper bound.  
**Fix:** Store `maxQuantity` in `CartItem`, use it as the cap in cart page.

### U3 — Product detail back button goes blank if accessed directly
**File:** `frontend/src/app/products/[id]/page.tsx` line 67  
`router.back()` with no history sends user to a blank tab.  
**Fix:** `router.back()` is fine, but add `router.push('/browse')` as a visible fallback link ("← Browse").

### U4 — Farmer dashboard earnings shows zeros when orders failed to load
**File:** `frontend/src/app/(protected)/farmer/page.tsx` — Earnings tab  
If order loading fails, stat cards show 0/0/0/0 with no indication of error.  
**Fix:** Show `ordersError` banner on Earnings tab the same way it shows on Orders tab.

### ✅ U5 — Phone validation rejects valid Kenyan formats
**Fixed in commit `pending`** — regex updated from `/^07\d{8}$/` to `/^0[17]\d{8}$/` to accept both `07XXXXXXXX` and `01XXXXXXXX` formats.

### U6 — Farmer cannot browse or access map
**File:** `frontend/src/components/Navbar.tsx` lines 23–34  
Farmers only see "Dashboard" and "Logout". They have no way to browse products or see the map (e.g. to check competitor prices or their own listing's map pin).  
**Fix:** Add Browse and Nearby links to farmer nav, or at minimum Browse.

### ✅ U7 — Cart category icon placeholder broken
Fixed with B1 (commit `5acf989`).

### U8 — MapView marker icons loaded from CDN
**File:** `frontend/src/components/MapView.tsx` lines 8–13  
Leaflet marker icons are loaded from `unpkg.com`. Map pins disappear if unpkg is slow or down.  
**Fix:** Copy the 3 icon files into `/public` and reference them locally.

## 🔵 Backend / Code Quality

### C1 — CORS wide open
**File:** `backend/src/index.ts` line 16  
`app.use(cors())` with no origin restriction. Fine for development, but should restrict to the frontend URL for production.  
**Fix (prod):** `app.use(cors({ origin: process.env.ALLOWED_ORIGIN }))`.

### C2 — No try/catch around DB operations in routes
All route handlers call Mongoose directly with no try/catch. Unhandled promise rejections go to `errorHandler` via Express's error propagation — which works, but only if Express catches the async error. Express 5 handles this automatically; Express 4 does not without `express-async-errors` or manual wraps.  
Check which Express version is installed. If v4, wrap handlers or add `require('express-async-errors')`.

### C3 — Order status update allows skipping steps
**File:** `backend/src/routes/orders.ts` line 114  
`body('status').isIn(['confirmed', 'ready', 'delivered'])` — a farmer can jump from `pending` directly to `delivered`, skipping `confirmed` and `ready`.  
**Fix:** Validate that status follows the sequence: only allow the next step based on `order.status`.

### C4 — errorHandler doesn't distinguish Mongoose validation errors
**File:** `backend/src/middleware/error.ts`  
All errors return 500 with `err.message`. Mongoose validation errors (wrong type, missing required field) should return 400, not 500. Currently a bad request to the DB returns the same status as a server crash.  
**Fix:** Check `err.name === 'ValidationError'` and return 400 with a cleaner message.

### C5 — reviews and admin routes are all 501 stubs
**Files:** `routes/reviews.ts`, `routes/admin.ts`  
These mount and register routes but all return 501. Not a bug but noted as future work (Phase 8 and 9).
